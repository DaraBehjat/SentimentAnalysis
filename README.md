SentimentAnalysis
=================

Software design project Sentiment Analysis for Software Design course at Olin College. 

This project looks to see if there is a correlation between the sentiment of articles published 
for a specific company and that company's change in stock price on that day. 

Capabilities of the project include pulling articles from an RSS feed of pre-determined news 
sources, parsing and saving these articles to text files, evaluating the sentiment of each 
article, identifying the articles related to a specific company and showing the correlation 
between its sentiment and stock price over past month.
