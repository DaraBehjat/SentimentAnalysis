Meanwhile, in one of many alternate futures…  
 
It seemed like a fairy story.  
When Jada met Malik online, they seemed to have plenty in common. His responses to her posts sparked her interest.  
And as she got to know him, their online relationship intensified.  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
She knew she was falling for him. He said he felt the same.  
Well, she  thought  he’d said that.  
One day, his messages slowed down. Passions cooled.  
Jada asked if she’d done anything wrong. She got an unusual response.  
“It’s not you: It’s  not me .”  
She’d never felt more humiliated than today: The day she learned she was in love with an  algorithm .
