      General Motors   ( GM ,  Fortune 500 )  led the way once again with 212,060 vehicles sold, up 14% versus 2012 for its best November in six years.      Ford   ( F ,  Fortune 500 )  sales rose 7% to 190,449, while Chysler's rose 16% to 142,275.  Toyota   ( TM )  came in at 178,044, up 6%, while Nissan sales rose 11% to 106,528.     Sales to individual buyers were particularly strong, a good sign for automakers. Individual sales typically come at higher prices than those to fleets, such as rental car companies.
