                      comments       EU regulator warns on dangers of Bitcoin   By Alanna Petroff   @AlannaPetroff     December 13, 2013: 9:40 AM ET               The European Banking Authority is considering regulating virtual currencies, including Bitcoin.           LONDON (CNNMoney)    The top banking watchdog in Europe has issued a strong warning about the risks of Bitcoin and may consider regulating virtual currencies as their global popularity grows.    In a report out Friday the European Banking Authority warned consumers that any investment in  Bitcoin  could become worthless, cautioning that digital currencies are completely unregulated, leaving people unprotected if they trade on platforms that crash or go out of business.

     It comes as  heavyweight investors ,  tech gurus  and  everyday consumers  clamor to boost their bitcoin holdings on the hope it will one day become a legitimate global currency.     The crypto-currency has soared in value this year -- from roughly $13 in January to peak above $1,200 -- and traded at $921 on the Mt.Gox exchange on Friday. The currency is prone to severe price volatility.      Related: What is Bitcoin      Bitcoin gained another high-profile backer this week in prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm  Andreessen Horowitz . The company is investing roughly $20 million into Coinbase, which provides "wallets" for the digital currency, allowing users to buy, sell and use bitcoins.     But the EBA report warned that these kinds of "digital wallets" are at risk of being hacked, leaving investors with nothing.

Last week  China's central bank  issued new rules prohibiting financial institutions from dealing in bitcoins.     But Bitcoin has received a measure of support from officials at the Federal Reserve, including chairman  Ben Bernanke , who said the currency "may hold long-term promise" as part of the international payment system.
