typo in first paragraph) 
WASHINGTON  Dec 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday
confirmed Representative Mel Watt to lead the agency that
regulates taxpayer-owned mortgage financiers Fannie Mae
 and Freddie Mac, providing greater leeway
for the Obama administration's mortgage aid initiatives. The Senate voted 57-41 to confirm Watt as the regulator of
the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Only two Republicans -
including Richard Burr, who is from Watt's home state - voted in
favor of the North Carolina Democrat.
