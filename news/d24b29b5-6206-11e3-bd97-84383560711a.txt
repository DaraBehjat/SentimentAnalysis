By Steve Slater and Richa Naidu Dec 10 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland said its
finance director, Nathan Bostock, had resigned to join Spanish
bank Santander after just 10 weeks in the job, dealing
a major blow to the state-backed lender's turnaround efforts. RBS said in a brief statement Bostock had on Tuesday evening
told the board his intention to resign and would formally resign
soon. The statement was rushed out after Sky News reported Bostock
had quit to return to Santander UK, where he had previously held
several positions, including chief financial officer. Santander confirmed late on Wednesday that Bostock would be
named chief risk officer and deputy CEO of its UK arm, which is
due to be spun off and separately listed. Given Ross McEwan's recent appointment as RBS chief
executive officer, Bostock may have opted to join Santander UK
as the CEO role there could become available before the top job
at RBS. Santander UK Chief Executive Ana Botin has been tipped
as a possible successor to her father Emilio Botin as chairman
of the Madrid-based group, maybe once the UK arm is floated. Bostock was appointed as RBS finance director on Oct. 1. The news is a major blow to McEwan, who is conducting a
review of the bank's strategy and operations, to be released in
February. McEwan has been hit by IT problems, which last month caused
more than 1 million RBS customers to be left stranded after a
computer systems failure. Bostock was previously head of RBS's restructuring and was
expected to play a key role alongside McEwan to create a 38
billion pound ($62.42 billion) internal 'bad bank' announced
last month. Bostock had previously said he planned to leave RBS to join
Lloyds Banking Group in 2011, but changed his mind after Antonio
Horta-Osorio, the Lloyds chief executive, took a period of sick
leave.
