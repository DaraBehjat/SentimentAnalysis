Looking ahead, the Census Bureau will publish data on new home sales at 10 a.m. ET. The Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book, a summary of regional economic conditions, at 2 p.m. ET.     Peter Cardillo, chief market strategist at Rockwell Global Capital, said ongoing concerns about when the Federal Reserve will start pulling back on its stimulus is giving investors an "excuse" to do some selling before the year is up.
