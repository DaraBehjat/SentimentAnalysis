(Money Magazine)   You've saved enough to leave a parting gift for the kids, but will they use their inheritance wisely?    You're not alone if you're concerned: 35% of people are crafting their estate plans to avoid mismanagement of money by their heirs, a recent survey from WealthCounsel found. Luckily, there's a lot you can do now to make sure your children won't have you rolling in your grave.

      Prep them for what's coming      Don't let your will reading be the first time an heir hears about his inheritance. Meet with adult beneficiaries to lay out your desires for your legacy.     "Children who talk with their parents about this are much more responsible in planning for their future with the money," says Waltham, Mass., financial planner Lea Ann Knight. She suggests giving kids the option to see a financial adviser or take a finance course if they'll inherit more than 50% of their income. That way, you can rest assured that they will avoid missteps due to financial ignorance.      Give them practice       Consider passing down some cash during your lifetime so that you can guide your heirs while you're still around, suggests Ann Arbor financial planner David Shotwell.

"Kids will make mistakes," adds Knight. "This way they can make them without blowing the whole inheritance."      Trust a trustee       A trust helps guarantee that your legacy is used as you intended. This document, which can be drafted by an estate attorney for $1,600 to $3,000, places the management of funds into the hands of someone you appoint, be it a friend, family member, or third party like a bank. You can leave instructions on when the money will be doled out.

Attach some strings       You can include additional hoops within a trust. Incentive trusts force an heir to meet requirements to receive funds, like earning a degree or passing a drug test; staggered trusts pay out incrementally, giving heirs a chance to mature as money is disbursed. Such arrangements can cause resentment, so explain yourself and treat each beneficiary independently.     Also, beware of making guidelines  too  strict. "The more structured the trust," says Austin financial planner Natalie Pine, "the more likely it'll do something you didn't intend."
