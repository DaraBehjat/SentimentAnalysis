OSLO  Dec 2 (Reuters) - Norway's gas output will be cut by
40 million cubic metres (mcm) per day on Monday due to an outage
affecting gas production from Royal Dutch Shell's Ormen
Lange field, above an earlier estimate for 25 mcm, gas system
operator Gassco said. 
Stormy weather disrupted external power supply to Nyhamna
plant that feeds the 70-million-cubic-metre Langeled pipeline,
Britain's main gas import route. The outage, which started at 0720 GMT was expected to last
for 15 hours, Gassco added in a market message.
