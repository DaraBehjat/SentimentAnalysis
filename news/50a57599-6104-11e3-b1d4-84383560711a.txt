     Marc Chandler, strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman, said investors seem undecided on the timing on when the Federal Reserve will pull back on its $85 billion a month bond purchasing. He said bonds did not sell off following the strong jobs report on Friday, so investors seem undecided as to whether the tapering is priced in, or whether it would have a sharp and immediate impact on markets beginning this month.     Friday's  strong jobs report  showed the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7% -- the lowest level since November 2008 -- as more people said they were getting jobs and joining the labor force.     That followed Thursday's report showing much stronger third-quarter growth in the U.S. economy than previously reported. And there was more positive news for the global economy over the weekend in the form of the first  major world trade  deal in nearly 20 years.

Investors are also looking ahead to a big Monday merger: American Airlines and  US Airways   ( LCC ,  Fortune 500 )  are set to come together to form the  largest air carrier in the world . The combination of the two airlines is expected to create a company that's larger than the current industry leader,  United Continental Holdings   ( UAL ,  Fortune 500 ) .
