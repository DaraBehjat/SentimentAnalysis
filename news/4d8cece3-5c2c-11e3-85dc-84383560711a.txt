If God is in the details, then  Homeland  is a heathen infidel.  
Episode 310 was not without its moments. In a season when there’s been too much setup–the yoga play!–and not nearly enough payoff–Dana Brody’s safe from her Afterschool Special–this episode was, at least, full of action. And it was quite satisfying, unless you start looking too closely or thinking about it too much.  
Over the last two seasons,  Homeland has been willing to take a chainsaw to plausibility if it moves the plot forward. And this episode, for all its virtues, is time to start up the ol’ Husqvarna.  
Showrunner Alex Gansa has suggested that the season is structured in three four-episode acts. Through those first two “acts” Saul’s Hail Mary play to get Javadi into power has come together with preposterous precision. Even a brutal double murder in a tony suburban Washington neighborhood can’t stall the progress of Saul’s production of “Hey Kids, Let’s Install a Dictator!”  
This week, midway through the final act, the odds swing violently the other way, because it helps the story. And what should have been a straightforward op depositing Brody near the Iranian border, runs smack upside Murphy’s Law.  
 
The road’s closed by a tanker?  Why not? An Iraqi patrol? I can believe that too. An IED? Okay. But a device big enough to flip a big pickup truck, and yet Brody doesn’t have a scratch. Well, um.  
It’s so preposterous that it took me out of the moment. But it does provide us with a nice little plot point–faced with real danger, Brody’s deep seated training surfaces. Forget name calling by the special ops guys, what our Brody needs is a little blood–no that’s what freaked him out in the first place–make that a  lot  of blood to straighten him out.  
The President’s Chief of Staff suggests terminating the operation with extreme prejudice, but is, like all evil-minded high-level politicians, he’s perfectly willing to take “no” for an answer from a subordinate with a luxurious beard.  
 
With Brody hunkered down, we end up with perhaps the most improbable situation of all. The mission’s aborted, and Carrie Mathison, 15 weeks pregnant with a fresh bullet wound, has now become the voice of reason. She’s the one who has to talk Brody off the ledge. This is, of course, all about giving Claire Danes a chance to display her famously quivering lip and play the scene with Brody on the verge of tears that she missed last week.  
But this time it’s all out of joint.  She’s  making the rational argument for once, and Brody is less in touch with reality than she is. (Could it have something to do with all those mind-bending anti-withdrawal drugs?)  
Carrie: “Stop and think this through. You have no sanction. No support on the ground. And no extraction plan. pause..lip quaver into mini sob   You  will   die  over there.”  
Brody: “No, you’re wrong, Carrie. You want to know why?  You’re gonna get me home.”  
Carrie: “No. Don’t say that. Do not put that on me. It’s a fantasy.”  
Brody: “You’ll find a way. I have faiiiith….You are the wind beneath my wiiiiiings”  
And with that our heroine drops an F-bomb and our antihero bolts off on his midnight run across the border. Successfully.
