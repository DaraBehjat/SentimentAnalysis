Two things right off the bat: First, there will be much discussion elsewhere about whether Liongate’s  The Hunger  Games : Catching Fire or Disney’s Frozen  will end up topping the box office this weekend. Not to sound like a broken record, but both films are doing very well. Which film ends up topping the box office only matters in so much as  Frozen will surely end up among the biggest “films that never topped the box office” list if it ends up second place this weekend. Second of all, the post-Thanksgiving weekend is among the worst on the calendar, sort of a desert between the Thanksgiving boom and the December holiday rush. Wide new releases, if there are any in a given year, generally do terribly and holdovers tend to fall pretty hard.  
Okay, that having been said, the sold wide release this weekend was  Out of the Furnace . If you remember last year, the dark and violent economically-tinged crime Killing Them Softly opened with $6 million despite starring  Brad Pitt  and receiving strong reviews. This year, it’s Christian Bale’s turn, as his dark and violent rust belt crime thriller opened with $1.88m yesterday after two days of limited release. So it also looks to open with about $6m for the weekend. Like  Killing Them Softly ,  Out of the Furnace is a very good film and I hope it finds an audience down the road. But it’s also a very grim and bleak character piece and precisely the thing that will get ignored in multiplexes when there are so many other more “entertaining” options out there during the prime Oscar season.  
Relativity spent $27 million on  Out of the Furnace,  way too much for a film like this, although risk was mitigated via foreign pre-sales and the like. While some may see this as a test of Christian Bale’s bankability, as it’s really his first “all by myself” wide release star vehicle since  American Psycho , it’s also the kind of film that had absolutely nothing to sell except Bale’s face on the poster. As I’ve written before, there are very few movie stars who can sell a movie all by themselves. Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, and Zoe Saldena are all “names”, but none of them are “box office” for a pure drama such as this.  
This is pretty much a template for the kind of film that we all want to see more or, but at a budget too high ( Killing Them Softly  cost $15 million)  to ever really make a profit unless it really breaks out overseas. Considering the biggest-grossing “veterans attempt to readjust to life after Iraq/Afghanistan” film, the Jake Gyllenhaal/ Natalie Portman /Tobey Maguire drama Brothers , earned $43m worldwide, this one just should have been much cheaper. Bale will be fine as he has American Hustle later this month. For those still inclined, let me merely say that fans of Christian Bale should seek Out of the Furnace out, as it features one of his very best low-key performances. It’s not as good, but it reminded me of Al Pacino’s equally surprising low-key star turn in Donnie Brasco  back in 1997.  
While the post-Thanksgiving weekend is often death for wide releases not named  The Last Samurai  or Behind Enemy Lines (you have to go to the very early 90′s/late 80′s to see a consistent run of solid openers), it has been a fine launching ground for uber-limited platform debuts of future Oscar contenders. Good Will Hunting , Juno, Up In the Air, and Black Swan all pulled in rock-solid debut weekends in their 7-15 screen debuts in 1997, 2007, 2009, and 2010 respectively. So the hope is that the dynamite four-screen debut of the Coen Bros.’ Inside Llewyn Davis , with an estimated over/under $325,000 for the weekend, is more indicative of those debuts in terms of long-term success.  
But of course, two of those films topped $100 million domestic and  Up In The Air  ($83m) is still the highest grossing “non-IMAX documentary” to never enter the box office top-five on a given weekend, and I’d wager that  CBS   CBS  Film’s 1960′s folk song character study would make a profit on a fifth of that.  Still,  Inside Llewyn Davis is not a star-filled western like True Grit or a crowd-pleasing and uplifting depression-era musical like  Oh Brother Where Art Thou? . It’s closer in tone to  A Serious Man  (which opened with $252,000 on six screens back in 2009), so that film’s $9 million total may be the end result Oscar-love or no.  
But Focus Features never took  A Serious Man wider than 262 screens, while CBS Films intends to expand Inside Llewyn Davis on December 20th. The soundtrack is sure to be a huge seller among film fans, and the marketing department is doing an excellent job of selling the film as the adventures of a man and his cat. I don’t want to presume too much after a day of limited release, but this one could frankly go either way, topping out at $8 million or crawling to $25 million depending on the awards season. It will find its way on many top-ten lists regardless, so consider that a recommendation.  
The rest of the news is all holdover related, and there isn’t much to report behind the two biggies. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire earned $7.7 million on Friday, down 75% from last Friday (again, it’s the weekend), but bringing its domestic total to $317m. The picture will end up with over/under $25m for its third weekend, although a Saturday kid-centric bump sending it closer to $30m would not surprise me. So a 17-day total of around $335m is in store for the  Jennifer Lawrence  vehicle. $400m+ is still likely, but it’s as much a matter of holding onto screens during the Christmas blitz as anything else. Offhand, I’d wager that it ends up almost identical to the first film’s $408m domestic total, which qualifies as an unqualified victory.  
Disney’s Frozen earned another $6.82 million, down 74% from its $26.8m Friday gross.  Tangled and Wreck It Ralph earned about 4.1x their Friday numbers over their respective second weekends, so a $27m frame would not surprise. The Oscar favorite has $109m domestic, and now its merely a question of whether it gets to $200m (probably) or $250m (hopefully). It’ll be over/under $130m by the end of the weekend, and with basically no kid-friendly films between now and the end of the year ( The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug -review on Monday - is too long, violent, and scary for the youngest of kids while The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and  Saving Mr. Banks are really for adults), Frozen is in a position to run the board on family audiences.  
There’s not much else to report at the moment. The Thanksgiving turkeys ( Oldboy , Homefront , and Black Nativity ) aren’t gaining much ground while Thor: The Dark World  should flirt with $190 million by the end of tomorrow. I’ll have more details tomorrow about the holdovers of note, as well as obviously the actual weekend estimates.
