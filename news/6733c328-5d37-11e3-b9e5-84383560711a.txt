BRASILIA  Dec 4 (Reuters) - Brazil antitrust watchdog Cade
ruled on Wednesday that Spain's Telefonica SA must exit
its direct and indirect stake in wireless carrier TIM
Participações SA or seek a new partner for its Vivo
mobile phone unit. 
In a decision at a meeting in Brasilia, the agency's board
of directors also ruled that a new partner for Vivo, Brazil's
largest mobile phone carrier and part of Telefonica Brasil SA
, will not be allowed to own a stake in another rival
in Brazil.
