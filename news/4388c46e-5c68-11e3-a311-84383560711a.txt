TORONTO  Dec 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's Canadian
arm sold more than all other carmakers in Canada in November
helped in part by strong sales in the Fusion, according to auto
sales data released on Tuesday. However, in terms of sales growth, Chrysler Canada 
sales rose almost 13 percent year-over-year in November
outpacing all of its Detroit competitors. Oakville, Ontario-based Ford Canada said November sales rose
1.1 percent. Consumers bought 19,668 Ford cars and trucks last
month, slightly higher than the 19,447 it sold during the same
month a year ago. Sales of Ford's passenger car rose 6.1 percent to 4,717,
while truck sales declined 0.3 percent to 14,951. Year-to-date, Ford leads in total sales, with 267,427 cars
and trucks sold. This marked a 3.2 percent rise from the same
period last year. Chrysler Canada reported a 12.9 percent jump in November
sales, bolstered in part by strong sales of both its 2013 Jeep
Cherokee and the all-new 2014 model. It sold 19,206 cars and trucks, compared with 17,013 sold
last November, and extended its year-over-year sales growth to
48 months. Car sales rose 9 percent to 3,053 last month, while truck
sales climbed 13.7 percent to 16,153. Overall vehicle sales for Chrysler Canada are up 6.8 percent
so far this year with 244,570 units sold, and are already ahead
of full year 2012 figures, Chrysler said. General Motors Canada reported a small sales gain of
0.6 percent, and said it sold 17,482 vehicles in November. The
Oshawa-heaquartered company said that data reflects one less day
of sales than in the same period last year. "Demand continues to build for Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and
Cadillac cars and trucks, including the all-new GMC Sierra,"
said John Roth, vice president of sales at General Motors of
Canada. Car sales climbed 3.1 percent to 5,114 units, while 12,368,
or 0.3 percent fewer, trucks were sold. Overall sales are up 2.7 percent this year, with consumers
purchasing 217,908 GM cars and trucks. In the United States, aggressive discounting and the
continued popularity of big pickup trucks helped propel November
vehicle sales well past expectations.
