     The unemployment rate dropped to 7.0% from 7.3%. It was expected to fall to 7.2%.     Investors are examining the data to determine when the Federal Reserve will scale back, or taper, its $85 billion per month stimulus program.     The bond market seems to be betting that the Fed may taper sooner rather than later. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose Friday to 2.9%, and is closing in on its 2013 high of near 3%. Bond yields rise when prices fall. So investors may be selling bonds because they expect the Fed to start slowing down its monthly Treasury purchases.
