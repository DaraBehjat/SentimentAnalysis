Last week I was invited to San Francisco for the  TED  Women 2013 Conference by the host of the conference,  Pat Mitchell , President   CEO of the  Paley Center for Media .  During my time there I heard some amazing stories from some truly remarkable people.

The opening session of the conference highlighted past TED Talk speakers and what has happened to them since giving their presentation. They showed highlight clips of the actual talks these speakers gave and then they brought them out live on stage to be interviewed. The ever gracious interviewer, Pat Mitchell, asked them to explain how their lives have changed since their talks took place. Here were a few of my favorites:  
Tony Porter :  Tony Porter is the co-founder of the nonprofit A Call to Men: The National Association of Men and Women Committed to Ending Violence Against Women. Tony gave a TED Talk about how as a 12-year-old boy he was put in a situation where some older boys in his neighborhood pressured him to take advantage of a mentally handicapped girl who didn’t have the mental capacity to say no. Tony shared how he felt ashamed to tell the group of boys prodding him that he didn’t want to because he was afraid the other boys would think he was weak or think he wasn’t a true man (his words). So he went into the room with her, shut the door, waited a few minutes, then unzipped his zipper and walked out of the room zipping up his pants so the other boys would think he had gone through with the act. He regretted his feeling of being ashamed and the fact that he felt he had to pretend to do something horrible in order to keep his “man card.” That experience changed his life and he set out on a mission to educate boys that it’s OK to treat women with respect, rather than treating them like objects. He wants men to understand that they can be kind and good and still keep their “man card.” His life’s mission has become to stop violence against women. His TED Talk was seen by over 1,101,557 viewers. His ability to impact the world for the better has grown tremendously due to the exposure.  
Angela Patton: Angela Patton set out to get a prison to agree to allow a father/daughter dance to take place in the prison for inmates who had daughters at home. She was tired of hearing stories from little girls about how much they missed their fathers who were serving time in prison. She approached the prison warden and convinced him to allow a father/daughter dance to take place at the prison – pink balloons and sparkling punch and all. The dance was a huge success and it brought the prison guards to tears to watch these prisoners as they traded in their orange jumpsuits for white shirts and ties in order to dance with their darling little daughters who came dressed up in their finest dresses. Angela’s TED Talk has received over 385,193 views, and that exposure has led Angela to becoming the CEO of  Girls For A Change  and the executive director of CAMP DIVA, a summer camp and after school program for African-American girls. Earlier this year she threw her second father/daughter dance in a prison and she is getting requests from prisons and prisoners all over the country to do dances in their prisons.  
The second day of the conference was filled with new talks by extraordinary people.  Each talk was more inspiring than the last.  One of my personal favorites was a talk about the importance of determination and perseverance by  Diana Nyad .  In 2013, at the age of 64, Diana made her fifth attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida, a total distance of 110 miles in about 53 hours. Diana was supported by a 35-person team who stayed nearby in boats. What I personally loved most about her story was the fact that she succeeded on her  fifth  attempt. Not the first or second or third…the  FIFTH ! Talk about perseverance toward achieving your life goal. Wow! Diana shared that her motto in life is “Find a Way.” If you have a dream then find a way to make it happen. No doubt that this is exactly what she did!  
I loved hearing each of the stories and every story shared at the conference was an inspiration. I am so grateful to  TED Talks  for providing a platform where these incredible experiences can be broadcast to the world.  Without TED shining a light on these individuals, many of us would likely never have the opportunity to hear their inspiring stories.  Thanks to the exposure from their TED Talks, these people and many others were able to get their story out to the world and then leverage that attention to affect positive change on a much bigger scale.  
Thank heavens for people who change the world for the better! Let’s all be one of them!
