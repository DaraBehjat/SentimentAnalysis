warning FRANKFURT, Dec 3 (Reuters) - German sporting goods maker
Adidas said it expects sales of soccer and running
gear to help it achieve its 2015 sales and profit targets, even
though it has not yet made as much progress towards them as it
originally hoped. Adidas, the world's second largest sportswear maker behind
Nike in terms of sales, set out in 2010 plans to
increase sales to 17 billion euros ($23 billion) in 2015 and
reach an operating margin of 11 percent that year. Those targets had come under scrutiny in recent weeks after
it warned on 2013 profit in September. "After three years, we are not where we thought we would be
in terms of the numbers," Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer
said on Tuesday at an investor day in Germany, citing high raw
material costs, adverse currency movements and a weak European
market as problems. However, he confirmed the 2015 goals and said sales would
rise by a high-single-digit percentage in 2014, when adjusted
for currency effects, while its operating margin would increase
by 1 percentage point next year. "This development will be driven by growth in all brands,
regions and markets in 2014, with running and football as key
drivers," the company said in a statement. Adidas has said it is in particular counting on next year's
soccer World Cup in Brazil to drive sales. "We know we can deliver the big results when it counts,"
added Hainer, saying the group had already increased sales by
almost 3 billion euros between 2010 and 2012. The 17 billion euro target compares with sales of 11 billion
in 2010, the year when it set out the 2015 plans. Analysts expect Adidas to report 2015 sales of 16.4 billion
euros, and 14.5 billion this year, according to Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S. To reach an 11 percent operating margin would mean
increasing its margin by 250 basis points over 2014 and 2015. It
is expected to reach 8.5 percent this year, a 100 basis point
increase compared with 2010. Also, while the group can expect a revenue boost from next
year's soccer World Cup in Brazil, such events require
significant marketing spend, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Allegra
Perry had said ahead of the investor day. Adidas shares were down 1 percent at 88.36 euros at 1328
GMT, in line with a 1 percent fall in the wider Dax index
 for German blue-chip companies.
