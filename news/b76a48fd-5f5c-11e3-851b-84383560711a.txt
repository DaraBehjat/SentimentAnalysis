The New York  Yankees,  financially stung  by not making the postseason last year, have already made $300 million of free-agent signings to get October baseball back to the Bronx.

Yesterday, the team signed outfielder Carlos Beltran to a three-year,  $45 million  contract. Beltran joins catcher Brian McCann (five years,  $85 million ), and outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury (seven years,  $153 million ) as new members of the Yankees. Also yesterday the Yankees resigned pitcher Hiroki Kuroda (one year,  $16 million ), bringing the total free agent pot for the Yankees to $300 million.  
Sure, with Curtis Granderson signing with the NewYork Mets and Robinson Canoâ€™s  departure to Seattle, the Yanks chop $30 million off of their payroll. But the team still needs a second baseman and another starting pitcher to fill in for the retired Any Pettitte.  
So look for the Yankees throw another $100 million in the free agent pot before spring training opens regardless of what happens with the  Alex Rodriguez   suspension . It is simple: for the Yankees the economics of winning in autumn exceed the  tax punishment  of exceeding the $189 payroll limit.
