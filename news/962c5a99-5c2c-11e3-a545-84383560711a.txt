* Wealth management drives profit; result tops estimates 
* Bank raises dividend by 2.7 percent * Canada's No. 4 bank is nation's first lender to report
results for quarter TORONTO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Bank of Montreal said on
Tuesday that its quarterly earnings rose 1 percent, topping
estimates, after stronger wealth management results offset
weaker income from the brokerage and U.S. Harris Bank units. BMO, Canada's No. 4 bank and the nation's first lender to
report results for the period, also raised its quarterly
dividend by 2.7 percent to 76 Canadian cents a share. Net profit rose to $1.09 billion ($1.02 billion), or C$1.62
a share, in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31 from C$1.08
billion, or C$1.59 a share, a year earlier. Excluding items such as C$37 million in integration costs
from the 2011 purchase of Wisconsin lender Marshall  &  Illsley,
the bank earned C$1.64 a share. That topped the analysts' average estimate of C$1.58 a
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Profit from the wealth management division nearly doubled to
C$312 million from C$164 million, with strong financial markets
and a robust U.S. dollar boosting assets under management by 14
percent. But earnings at BMO Harris Bank fell 28 percent to US$102
million, which its parent attributed to weaker revenue and
higher-than-normal commercial loan loss provisions. Profit at BMO Capital Markets, the bank's brokerage unit,
dropped 27 percent to C$229 million. Securities gains and stock
underwriting fees fell, and trading revenue decreased from a
strong year-earlier quarter. BMO's flagship Canadian retail bank earned C$469 million, up
6 percent, as loan growth more than made up for narrowing
interest margins. Retail banking has been a strength for
Canadian lenders in spite of concerns that a slowing housing
market and low interest rates would pinch profit.
