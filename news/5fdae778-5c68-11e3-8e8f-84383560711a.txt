Microsoft today placed a $3.25 billion offering across 1.625% five-year notes at T+35, 3.625% 10-year notes at T+90, and 4.875% 30-year bonds at T+105, sources said. Spreads were set firm to initial whispers in the T+45, T+100, and T+110 areas, respectively.  
The five-year yield was, at the time, the lowest recorded in 2013, after Microsoft established the lowest-ever funding costs at that tenor with 0.875% notes due 2017 inked last November at T+27, or 0.993%.  
For reference, the 2.375% notes due 2023 traded in recent sessions at G-spreads in the high T+80s, while the 3.75% bonds due 2043 changed hands yesterday in the low T+90s, trade data show.  
Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft’s spreads, triple-A ratings profile, and stable ratings outlooks have held steady this year through a round of aggressive fiscal developments, including the announcement in September of a new $40 billion share-repurchase authorization and a 22% increase to its dividend payout.  
Also in the third quarter, Microsoft agreed to acquire Finland-based  Nokia   Nokia ’s devices and services business and to license Nokia’s patents and mapping services, for total consideration of roughly $7.2 billion. The company earmarked its large balances of overseas cash for the acquisition.  
Of note, Microsoft faces the maturity next June of $2 billion of 2.95% notes, which represent its only long-term maturity next year. It bought back nearly $6 billion of its shares over the 12 months through September, or the most in two years, according to S P Capital IQ.
