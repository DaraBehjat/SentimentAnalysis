  Politicians from both parties have used social programs to gain votes for years. Prior to its passage, we were told that Obamacare carried an economic advantage in addition to insuring the uninsured and making  health  care more affordable. Will it live up to its lofty promises or will it turn out to be yet another expensive and inefficient government program, leaving taxpayers on the financial hook? If nothing else, the timing was quite interesting. Why, for example, did  Washington  set its sights on the U.S. health care system during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression?  
 
In this article, we’ll discuss each of these questions and more. Despite its challenges, if timing really is everything, this may be the perfect time for a plan such as this. Confused? Read along as we conduct a thorough, physical examination of the Act that is changing the American health care system. After all, America voted for change and change is exactly what we got.  
Where Do Votes Come From?  
Health care has been the subject of public debate for over two decades. In the early 1990′s,  Hillary Clinton , in the capacity of First Lady, attempted to garner enough support to pass a universal-type health care law. In 1993, however, there was not enough public support to pass such a bill. In fact, the following year, Republicans won a major coup d’ tat in the midterm election as the political climate shifted to the right. Although her idea didn’t pass, it may have signaled the beginning of a shift in American social policy. The only thing Hillary needed at the time was more votes. What’s the best way to get votes? I’m very glad you asked. To find the answer, we’ll need to turn back the clock about 130 years to the 1880′s. This was the decade that President James A. Garfield was assassinated and Bob Ford killed the notorious outlaw Jesse James.  
During this era, about 4,000 miles away, there lived a man by the name of Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Germany. Bismarck was highly educated, fluent in five languages, and instrumental in the formation of the German  Empire   Empire . An arch conservative, Bismarck’s opposition included the progressives, the liberals, and the socialists. Even so, Bismarck knew how to get votes and votes are the main ingredient for political success. He understood that he needed to appeal to the burgeoning working class. To create this appeal, and win their votes, Bismarck said, “A man with a pension for his old age is much easier to deal with than a man without that prospect.” He went on to say, “Whoever embraces this idea will come to power.” Bismarck understood that creating a “social net” for workers would win their vote. Ironically, being an arch conservative, and hence, resistant to change, implementing a socialized pension system for the working class was a significant departure from his former ways.  
In 1908, Britain’s liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer (i.e.; the equivalent of our Dept of Treasury), David Lloyd George, followed Bismarck’s example and introduced a means-tested pension for those over the age of 70. Three years later, in 1911, Britain passed the National Health Insurance Act. George shared Bismarck’s insight that such policies were vote-winners, especially in a system where the poor greatly outnumbered the rich. Hence, the die was cast for contemporary political strategy.  
Back to the Future  
During the height of the 2008 financial crisis, this sentiment emerged again in the voice of President Obama’s Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel stated, “You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.” He understood that in times of pain and suffering, the masses are seeking relief and mostly from government. Hence, when the near collapse of the financial system occurred, it created a unique opportunity to implement social programs which, under normal economic conditions, might never have had a chance. How will we know if this is the perfect time for Obamacare? Considering the problems that have occurred thus far, even with something as basic as not hiring the best people to create healthcare.gov, if problems persist, and Obamacare continues to grab negative headlines, its chance of survival could be slim.  
Conclusion  
Has this issue awakened the conservative-minded sleeping giant? If so, is it large enough to slay the Socialistic dragon? In short, are there more voters on the right or the left? Even today, many aspects of Obamacare remain unsettled. Is this the perfect time for a plan such as Obamacare? As Bismarck realized, social programs are more acceptable when the poor outnumber the rich. Therefore, as our unemployment rate remains elevated and our economy sluggish, are there enough votes and support to sustain this program or will the November 2014 election be a repeat of 1994? I suppose we’ll have to wait until next November to find out.
