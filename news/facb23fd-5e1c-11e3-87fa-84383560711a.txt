Top talent is the most important source of competitive advantage — especially in the high technology industries, which compete on innovation. That’s why top talent recruitment is the most important aspect in the business strategy of high technology companies.  
But there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  
The right way is to recruit top talent one employee at a time, by going through the traditional process of screening and evaluation.  
Though slow, this process usually begins the right way, with the demand side of the market, the customers and their needs. It then advances with the development of the right value proposition. Finally, it ends up with the hiring of the right talent (e.g.,  Apple   Apple  and  Qualcomm   Qualcomm ). In addition, this process allows prospective employers to determine not only the technical skills of different candidates, but also their philosophical preparation for working with others to advance the cause of the organization.  
The wrong way is to acquire talent by the dozen, by buying out other technology companies.  
Though fast, this process usually begins the wrong way, with the supply side of the market, with resources amassed in markets that have now matured, and which leadership seeks to deploy in emerging markets, where the company is lagging behind its peers.  
The problem with this strategy is that it may be costly, as acquirers end up paying a larger and larger premium for the companies they acquire. This results in the enriching of the shareholders of third parties, rather than their own.  
Worse, it may be “behind the curve”–lead to the acquisition of the wrong talent, if the acquirer ends up buying the industry loser (e.g.,  Hewlett-Packard   Hewlett-Packard ’s acquisition of Palm). That’s why every second decade large companies end-up selling off the smaller companies they purchased in a previous decade.  
As legendary investment manager  Peter Lynch  put it,  “Every second decade the corporations seem to alternate between rampant diworseification (when billions are spent on exciting acquisitions) and rampant restructuring (when those no-longer-exciting acquisitions are sold off for less than the original price). The same thing happens to people who buy sailboats.”  
“These frequent episodes of acquiring and then regretting, only to divest and acquire and regret once again, could be applauded as a form of transfer payment from the shareholders of the large and cash-rich corporation to the shareholders of the smaller equity being taken over, since the large corporations so often overpay.” ( Cisco Systems   Cisco Systems  is a large technology company that comes to my mind).  
Simply put, what comes by the dozen goes by the dozen. That’s certainly not the right way to treat top talent.
