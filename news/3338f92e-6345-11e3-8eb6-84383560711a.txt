Early in my career, I had a steep learning curve. As most entrepreneurs can relate to, you’ve got to learn a lot of things very quickly. One of the most important early lessons I gained was what my image meant for my business. I realized that whether I was raising capital or trying to sell services, as the leader my company’s reputation was bound up with my own. Early on, I struggled with how best to both grow and manage a strong image in the community. Today, the idea of building a positive reputation publicly and internally has been termed your “personal brand.” Although the term has been criticized, I think it’s helpful to understand that it’s what leaders have been doing for centuries.  
I think it’s important to keep in mind that personal branding isn’t  an exercise in narcissism , as some have claimed, but rather a key tool for both an entrepreneur’s professional development and the growth of your company. It’s also a tool that, without articulating it in the more contemporary way, every successful businessman and public figure in modern history has used. There is a reason we enjoy concerts at  Carnegie  Hall and send our children to college at schools named  Vanderbilt  and  Vasser : all those men understood that leaders had a responsibility to their businesses to maintain a positive image in their communities.  
In this article, I’ll share some suggestions on building your brand in the eyes of the community. These tools and tips have worked for me and I’m hopeful you’ll find them helpful.  
 
Building a personal brand in public comes with some dangers. As the leader of a company, you are its most important ambassador. When people see you, they see your company. Which means that when you are cultivating a personal brand, you should understand the implications for your business. I’ve found it’s important to ask yourself what you want a potential client or customer to see when they interact with you or with your brand. Because their experience with you will, without a doubt, influence how they see your business. That’s a big responsibility.  
If you are serious about cultivating your personal brand, everywhere your name appears should be consistent with that brand, whether that’s on Facebook and LinkedIn or at a networking event. The best advice I have for maintaining consistency across the board is to remain true to yourself. If your personal brand doesn’t feel personal, you may need to do some soul searching to find out what best represents who you are.  
This same approach applies also to your community building activities. I think civic leadership is important for entrepreneurs because it builds trust in both you and your company. In my hometown of Richmond, Va., I joined forces with a friend to set up Richmond Unite, a fundraising vehicle for local youth organizations. That’s a cause I support because it’s important to me so I suggest finding something you are passionate about when you are getting involved.  
As an entrepreneur, the community that supports your business will benefit from your creativity and energy. And, in my experience, the trust that these efforts build around your brand and your business pays off as people will be more likely to think of you when they need the services your company provides.  
Beyond your web presence and community involvement, there are virtually endless opportunities to build your personal brand. The same creativity and thought you applied to building your business, should be applied to building your personal brand. Seeking out speaking opportunities, for example, is a great way to build your communications skills and position yourself as a thought leader.  
The media is another tool for building your brand. Interacting with the news media can be nerve-racking because you are trusting a reporter to get your story right and convey your message accurately. Many entrepreneurs I’ve met will simply clam up and look for a place to hide if a reporter calls. But one thing to keep in mind is that most reporters, especially business and metro reporters, are usually not calling to run a damning expose on your company.  
So don’t be afraid to answer the phone when they call. Or, even better, get their number and reach out to them when you think you or your company has done something newsworthy. Reporters will generally appreciate you thinking about them for a story. Another option is to hire a PR firm to approach your communications strategically. A good PR firm will be as protective and diligent about your personal brand as you are.  
Those are a few of my ideas. How are you building your personal brand?
