NEW YORK (CNNMoney)    Aubrey McClendon is getting back in the game.

     McClendon will manage the business for the partnership, known as American Energy Capital Partners. He is supported by "a large and growing staff of over 125 oil and gas professionals," according to the filing.

Chesapeake had been facing scrutiny over a bizarre arrangement under which McClendon borrowed  more than $1 billion  backed by personal stakes in the company's wells, though the firm said this practice was unrelated to his departure.     McClendon and American Energy Capital Partners could not be reached for comment.     McClendon is a  part-owner  of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team, whose arena bears Chesapeake's name.               First Published: December 13, 2013: 7:54 PM ET
