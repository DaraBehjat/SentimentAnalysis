ABUJA  Dec 11 (Reuters) - Nigeria's Senate launched an
investigation on Wednesday into a letter written by the central
bank (CBN) which said that the state-oil firm NNPC failed to pay
$50 billion of revenue from oil sales into government accounts. 
NNPC earned $65.3 billion from crude oil sales between
January 2012 and July 2013 but only remitted 24 percent of this
to the government's account and $49.8 billion was still
outstanding, according to a letter from the CBN Governor Lamido
Sanusi to President Goodluck Jonathan seen by Reuters. NNPC sold 46 percent of Nigeria's oil in the 18-month period
but its remittance amounted to only one-third of the taxes paid
by private oil companies, like Royal Dutch Shell and
Exxon Mobil, which exported the other 54 percent, the
letter claimed. NNPC says the CBN has misunderstood the figures. "The matter will be investigated by the Senate finance
committee headed by Ahmed Markafi and (it is) to report back as
quickly as possible but certainly not more than one week,"
Senate President David Mark said. NNPC has been criticised for lacking transparency and for
diverting funds in several investigations in recent years but
the central bank governor appears to be one of the most
high-profile figures to have brought up the issue with Jonathan. OPEC-member Nigeria is Africa's second largest economy and
top oil producer, pumping around 2-2.5 million barrels per day.
Oil revenues make up 80 percent of government revenues.
