     But the enthusiasm was short-lived. Stocks pulled back following a disappointing report on the housing market. Pending home sales dropped 0.6% in October from the prior month. That was the fifth straight decline. Economists expected a 1.3% increase. The housing recovery has been a big boon for the stock market this year, so signs of weakness are worrisome.     Earlier, investors seemed encouraged by a landmark deal reached between Iran and the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany over the weekend.     As part of the  agreement , world powers will relax economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for a promise that the country scales back its nuclear program.  Oil prices  sank on the expectation of  more oil exports  from Iran following the  nuclear deal .     World markets also climbed on the news.  European markets  were higher in afternoon trading, with Germany's benchmark  Dax  index leading the way. Most  Asian markets  ended higher, with Japan's  Nikkei  jumping 1.5% as the yen weakened against the dollar.

Trading volume is expected to be low during this holiday-shortened week and there are few economic and earnings reports on tap.     U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and will shut at 1 p.m. ET on Friday.     In company news,  Wal-Mart   ( WMT ,  Fortune 500 )  announced that current CEO of Wal-mart International Doug McMillon will replace CEO Mike Duke, who plans to retire early next year.      Apple   ( AAPL ,  Fortune 500 )  bought the Israeli company PrimeSense. Apple's stock was up about 1% in early trading.
