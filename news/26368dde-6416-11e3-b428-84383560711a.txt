     The company also plans to open new factories in Brazil and China, and will introduce 23 new vehicles globally.     "The last time  Ford   ( F ,  Fortune 500 )  was growing like this, Dwight D. Eisenhower was the U.S. president," John Fleming, Ford's executive vice president for manufacturing, said in a statement.      Related: GM names Mary Barra as CEO      Unlike rivals  General Motors   ( GM ,  Fortune 500 )  and Chrysler, Ford  avoided  a taking a federal bailout following the financial crisis. However it has had its own struggles,  laying off  and  buying out  tens of thousands of workers over the past decade.     But in recent months things have been looking up for the industry, which has been buoyed by low gas prices, increased access to credit and pent-up demand.     Ford's  November sales  rose 7% versus last year, and the company says it's gaining U.S. market share at a faster rate than any of its competitors.
