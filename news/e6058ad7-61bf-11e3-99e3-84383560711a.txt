                       US car giant General Motors (GM) has promoted product development chief Mary Barra to the post of chief executive.  
         She replaces Daniel Akerson, and is the first woman to run a US carmaker. 
         Mr Akerson, who is also currently chairman of the company, will leave both of his posts in mid-January. His wife has recently been diagnosed with advanced cancer.   
         Earlier this week the US government sold its remaining shares in GM, the world s second biggest carmaker. 
         Overall, it lost around $10bn (Â£6bn) on its bailout of the carmaker in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.

       The US Treasury spent $49.5bn bailing out GM, and took a 61% stake in the company. 
   'Satisfaction' 
	       Ms Barra has been in charge of design and engineering, and before that was head of human resources at the company. 
         She joined GM as a student in 1980.  
         In a message to the company s employees on Tuesday, Mr Akerson said:  I will leave with great satisfaction in what we have accomplished, great optimism over what is ahead and great pride that we are restoring General Motors as America s standard bearer in the global auto industry.   
         Current chief financial officer, Dan Ammann, was named GM president. He will also take responsibility for the Cadillac and Chevrolet brands.
