                       Spanish football giant Barcelona has signed a deal with Intel to allow the chipmaker s logo to appear on the inside of players  shirts.  
         The Intel logo would be revealed when players lift their shirts to celebrate scoring a goal, Barcelona officials told a news conference on Thursday.  
         It will make its debut on Saturday during the La Liga match at home to Villarreal, the club said.  
         Intel will also provide technology to the players and coaching staff. 
         Players, who include Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta, would not have to wear the  Intel Inside  logo, said Barcelona.  
         Intel paid $25m (Â£15m) for the deal, according Forbes magazine. 
         Chief marketing officer at Intel, Deborah Conrad, said she chose Barcelona as it had an active social media community and hundreds of millions of fans globally.  
         She said:  We did not want to put the players under any obligation to show the logo a specific number of times but we do know that such goal celebrations are a big part of the culture of the sport.   
         The football club is also sponsored by Nike, Audi, and Qatar Airways. 
         The airline s logo will stay on the outside of the players  shirts.
