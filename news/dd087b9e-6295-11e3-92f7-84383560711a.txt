     Congressional negotiators reached a  bipartisan budget compromise  late Tuesday that would prevent another government shutdown, if approved by the House and Senate. The deal would set spending levels, reduce the deficit and relieve some of the arbitrary, forced spending cuts.     Some analysts say the deal could make the Fed more likely to announce it will begin trimming its $85-billion-a-month bond purchases as early as next week. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has said repeatedly that uncertainty about fiscal policy is a threat to the economy.     "This budget agreement probably increases the odds of a taper sooner rather than later," said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management.     Still, many investors say the Fed will remain on hold at next week's policy meeting, despite a recent run of strong employment data. The general consensus is that Fed vice chair Janet Yellen, who has been nominated to succeed Bernanke and is awaiting final approval from the Senate, will begin tapering early next year.

The stock, which has more than doubled from its IPO price, was a trending topic on StockTwits.     " $TWTR  laughs in the face of general market fear," said  PTSD_Trader .     But not all investors were convinced the gains would hold, and some were betting Twitter shares will fall.     " $TWTR  longs are weak and will jump ship This company ain't worth 50's. We will see 40's soon enough. Shorts will prevail," said  fierce1814 .      BlackBerry   ( BBRY )  shares rose for a second day. The troubled smartphone maker has been punished this year, with shares down nearly 50%. BlackBerry is set to report quarterly results next week, and some traders are hoping for good news.     " $BBRY  big news coming down the pike in my opinion," said  newday1 .     Others say the rebound in BlackBerry stock is probably not the beginning of a longer-term recovery.     " $BBRY  up two days in a row. means nothing, just green in red so pointing out..." said  howardlindzon .     Shares of  MasterCard   ( MA ,  Fortune 500 )  rose after the company said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 83% and announced a share buyback program. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split effective in January.     vidConfig.push({ videoArray : [ {id : "/video/investing/2013/12/11/investing-the-buzz-mastercard-stock-split-google-priceline-apple.cnnmoney", hed: "Swipe this!

Smith   Wesson   ( SWHC )  shares jumped a day after the gun maker  reported quarterly earnings  that beat expectations.      Groupon   ( GRPN )  shares rose following positive reports from Wall Street analysts.      Costco   ( COST ,  Fortune 500 )  shares dropped after the company reported quarterly profits that fell just short of analysts' expectations.     Bank stocks were under pressure one day after federal regulators officially approved new  restrictions on risky trading  by federally-insured financial institutions.  Goldman Sachs   ( GS ,  Fortune 500 )  fell more than 1%.  Morgan Stanley   ( MS ,  Fortune 500 ) ,  Citibank   ( C ,  Fortune 500 ) ,  Bank of America    ( BAC ,  Fortune 500 ) and  JPMorgan    ( JPM ,  Fortune 500 ) also dipped.      European markets  closed lower.  Asian markets  were also weak.               First Published: December 11, 2013: 9:47 AM ET
