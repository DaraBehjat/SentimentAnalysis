* Oando deal with Conoco worth $1.79 bln 
* Company seeking additional financing for the deal LAGOS  Dec 2 (Reuters) - Nigeria's Oando said on
Monday that it has delayed the completion of its $1.79 billion
deal to buy Conocophillips' Nigerian assets by two
months to January. Oando has been seeking equity and bank loan funding for the
deal and to finance its transition from a marketer of refined
petroleum products into an upstream business focused on oil and
gas exploration and production. The deal to acquire Conoco's fields, which were producing
about 43,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) last year and have
proven reserves of 213 million barrels of oil equivalent, was
scheduled to close in November. But analysts have long questioned whether Oando can persuade
investors to deliver the funds. It is listed in Toronto 
and Johannesburg and has committments from banks for
several hundred million dollars in loans. The statement through the Johannesburg stock exchange added
that Oando would pay a $15 million deposit by Dec. 6, on top of
the $435 million deposit it has already paid. This leaves about $1.23 billion to pay after adjustments,
the company said. Oando chief executive Wale Tinubu has said that the
company's upstream business will account for about three
quarters of its assets after the Conoco acquisition, against 40
percent now.
