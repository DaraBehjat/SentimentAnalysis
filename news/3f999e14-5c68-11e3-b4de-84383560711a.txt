NEW YORK  Dec 3 (Reuters) - Dennis Kozlowski, the former
Tyco International Ltd chief executive who went to prison for
looting the company of more than $100 million, was granted
parole Tuesday, according to New York state officials. 
A New York state parole board tentatively agreed to release
Kozlowski next month, according to the state's Department of
Correctional Services. Kozlowski, once dubbed the poster boy for corporate fraud,
was sentenced in 2005 to 8-1/2 to 25 years in prison following
his conviction on grand larceny, securities fraud and other
charges.
