                      comments       American, US Air cleared to land merger   By Chris Isidore   @CNNMoney     November 27, 2013: 11:40 AM ET               US Airways and American Airlines are now set to merge into the largest airline company on Dec. 9.         NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   A federal bankruptcy court judge has cleared the way for American Airlines and US Airways to merge into the world's largest airline company, dismissing a final objection from a group of airline passengers trying to block the deal.    Judge Sean Lane approved an  antitrust settlement  reached earlier this month between the airlines and the Justice Department.  Justice's earlier objections  to the deal had been the major impediment to the merger.

     But the department believes that concessions made as part of the settlement, including the transfer of some key airport slots to low-cost carriers such as  JetBlue   ( JBLU ,  Fortune 500 )  and  Southwest,   ( LUV ,  Fortune 500 )  will provide for increased competition     While the passenger group has indicated that it intends to pursue a private antitrust case against the merger, Lane ruled that should not stop American parent  AMR   ( AAMRQ ,  Fortune 500 )  from  emerging from bankruptcy  and  combining with US Airways . The passengers still believe the merger will result in higher fares and reduced choice.     The merger of the two companies is now set to take place Dec. 9, with the shares in the new combined American Airlines trading under the symbol AAL.

Details about when the airlines will combine reservations and ticketing, frequent flier clubs and other operations are still being worked out, and those combinations are not likely until the beginning of 2014, at the earliest.

But the combined company that will exist on Dec. 9 will be the largest airline in the world in terms of revenue, passengers carried and the number of miles flown by paying passengers, surpassing  United Continental Holdings   ( UAL ,  Fortune 500 ) , which was also formed by a merger.
