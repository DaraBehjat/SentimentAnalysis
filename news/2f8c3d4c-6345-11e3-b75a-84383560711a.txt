TORONTO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index
slipped on Thursday to its lowest in nearly eight weeks after a
slew of economic data from the United States raised fears that
the Federal Reserve might soon begin rolling back its monetary
stimulus program.
    The Toronto Stock Exchange's S /TSX composite index
 was down 46.62 points, or 0.35 percent, at 13,086.80
shortly after the open.
