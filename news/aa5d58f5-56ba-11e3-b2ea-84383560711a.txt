     Trading volumes are expected to remain low this week as investors gear up for Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.      U.S. stocks  had initially pushed higher Monday after diplomats forged a  landmark deal with Iran  over the weekend, but the move lacked conviction and stocks ended little changed.     "If you spent yesterday in bed, ignoring the market reaction to the Iranian sanctions-lifting deal, you made the right choice," said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes of London in his market report.     Despite the lackluster action, the  Dow  managed to eke out a record close, and the Nasdaq crossed 4,000 for the first time in more than 13 years.
