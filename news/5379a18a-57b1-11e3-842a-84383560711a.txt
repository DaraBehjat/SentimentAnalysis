* HP, Apple lead tech sector's gains 
* U.S. jobless claims fall, signaling better labor market * Consumer sentiment, regional manufacturing top forecasts * Dow up 0.1 pct; S  500 up 0.1 pct; Nasdaq up 0.5 pct By  Angela Moon NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq advanced on
Wednesday to its highest level since September 2000 as
Hewlett-Packard lifted the tech sector a day after the company's
earnings. The Dow and the S  500 were little changed by midday trade,
trimming earlier gains that were driven by a batch of positive
economic reports. Overall trading volume was light, with many traders out for
the Thanksgiving holiday. The U.S. stock market will be closed
on Thursday. Regular trading will finish early at 1 p.m. (1800
GMT) on Friday. Big tech names were among the day's top gainers. Apple Inc
 shares rose 2.1 percent to $544.41. Hewlett-Packard's
stock jumped 9.5 percent to $27.47 a day after the
company reported better-than-expected results. Wall Street has soared this year, largely on expectations of
continued stimulus from the Federal Reserve. Both the Dow and
the S  500 have risen more than 20 percent in 2013, hitting a
series of all-time highs, while the Nasdaq closed above 4,000
for the first time since 2000 on Tuesday. "It may be too complacent not to expect a correction or a
pullback (with indexes) at these levels, but if you look at the
setbacks in 2013, they've served as an opportunity to get into a
stronger bull market," said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic
strategist at Miller Tabak  &  Co in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.10 points,
or 0.06 percent, at 16,081.90. The Standard  &  Poor's 500 Index 
 was up 2.29 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,805.04. The
Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 19.274 points, or 0.48
percent, at 4,037.023. The Nasdaq earlier hit an intraday high
at 4,039.861, its highest since September 2000. Energy shares were the day's worst-performing sector. The
S  index of energy shares fell 0.9 percent as Brent oil
futures dropped on a higher-than-expected increase in U.S. crude
oil inventories. Newfield Exploration shares fell 4.7 percent to
$28.11 while Noble Energy slid 5 percent to
$69.51. The holiday shopping season unofficially begins on Friday,
and there has already been unprecedented price-cutting from the 
discount chain Wal-Mart Stores Inc as well as
earlier-than-usual deals from online company Amazon.com Inc
 and price-match promises from Best Buy Co Inc 
and Target Corp. The S  retail index rose 0.4
percent. But short sellers seemed to be targeting the retail sector,
according to SunGard's Astec Analytics. "Ahead of Black Friday, short sellers in the U.S. seem to be
holding some skepticism in the retail sector, hinting at
concerns over the gift-buying season. The number of U.S. retail
equity shares being borrowed, a proxy for short selling, is
seeing a late surge," said Karl Loomes, market analyst at
SunGard's Astec Analytics, in a client note. But he noted that Macy's Inc and Sears Holding
 were the two exceptions, with the number of shares
borrowed falling 13 percent and 6 percent, respectively, for the
last seven days. Among the data that increased optimism about the pace of
global growth, weekly jobless claims for unemployment benefits
unexpectedly fell in the latest week, a sign of steady
improvement in the labor market. Analysts were expecting a rise
in claims. The November Chicago Purchasing Managers Index and the final
November reading for the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan 
consumer sentiment index also exceeded expectations, indicating
that conditions continue to improve. The price of the digital currency bitcoin soared above
$1,000 for the first time on Wednesday, extending a surge this
month after a U.S. Senate committee's hearing on virtual
currencies. Bitcoin hit a high of $1,073 on Tokyo-based exchange Mt.
Gox, the best-known operator of a bitcoin digital marketplace,
compared with just below $900 the previous day.
