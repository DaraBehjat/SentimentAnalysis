Showtime has operated in the shadow of HBO for years, both in terms of original series and sports programming. HBO broadcast hit shows like the Sopranos and Sex and the City, as well as top-level boxing and the Emmy Award-winning  Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel. HBO had twice as many subscribers as CBS-owned Showtime as recently as 2005.  
 
   
 
But over the past few years, Showtime has raised its profile with shows like Homeland and the since wrapped Dexter. It launched 60 Minutes Sports at the end of 2012 to compete with Real Sports. But the biggest power shift between the networks came in boxing. Showtime rocked the industry by signing  Floyd Mayweather  to the “ richest individual athlete deal in all of sports ” in February after Mayweather spent 14 years fighting on HBO.  
The loss of Mayweather was a huge blow to HBO. His nine HBO pay-per-view telecasts generated 9.6 million buys and $543 million in revenue for the network’s PPV arm. Showtime produced the two biggest boxing PPV events of 2013 thanks to the addition of Mayweather to its boxing stable. Mayweather’s victory over Roberto Guerrero in May attracted roughly one million PPV buys and his September fight with Canelo Alvarez was the  highest grossing fight  in the history of the sport with total revenues approaching $200 million and a PPV audience of 2.2 million. HBO’s two boxing PPV events in 2013 had a combined 850,000 buys.  
“Floyd has been a great advocate for CBS and Showtime,” says Showtime Sports boss Stephen Espinoza. “It has been a dream partnership. I couldn’t have planned the first year of our relationship to go any better than it has.”  
The Mayweather defection from HBO to Showtime also  triggered a split  between HBO and Golden Boy, which is the biggest promoter in the fight game and has worked with Mayweather in all of his recent fights. Golden Boy promotes other stars like Alvarez, Adrien Broner, Bernard Hopkins, Amir Khan and Danny Garcia, who all appeared on Showtime this year. Ratings for Showtime Championship Boxing increased 21% over last year and 59% from 2011. “It’s the strongest year of sports programming since Showtime got into this genre,” says Espinoza (Showtime’s first sports programming was boxing in 1986).  
Showtime wraps its 2013 Championship Boxing telecasts on Saturday with a four-fight event from San Antonio headlined by the WBA Welterweight title bout between Broner and Marcos Maidana. Broner is one of the sport’s rising stars and some feel the heir apparent to Mayweather. His win over Paulie Malignaggi in June attracted Showtime’s biggest audience of the year, outside of Mayweather’s PPV bouts, with a peak audience of 1.3 million people.  
Mayweather has attracted new fans to Showtime. The Canelo fight, billed as The One, was a blockbuster, and attracted massive attention for the network in the weeks leading up to the bout. But even the Guerrero fight grabbed a new audience with some PPV operators reporting as many as 40% of buyers for the bout as not having purchased another PPV fight in recent years, according to Espinoza.  
Espinoza told Forbes in the spring that he hoped the Mayweather signing would close the subscriber gap with HBO. Both networks gained about 500,000 subscribers in the first three quarters of the year, according to SNL Kagan, but momentum is clearly on Showtime’s side. The network has added nine million subscribers since 2005, while HBO’s subscriber growth is flat during the same period. The spread currently stands at 29.2 (HBO) to 22.8 (Showtime), per SNL Kagan.  
CBS’s cable networks include the Movie Channel, Flix and CBS Sports Network, but the biggest revenue driver is Showtime. The CBS Cable Networks segment reported revenue of $596 million in the third quarter, up 37%, and operating income of $261 million, up 15%. Needham   Co. estimates the September Mayweather PPV added $75 million to CBS’s third quarter revenue. Revenues for the segment are expected to hit a record $2.1 billion in 2013. CBS’s cable revenues are up 63% the past five years with earnings soaring 134%, which has helped offset weakness in CBS’s Local Broadcasting division where revenues have dropped. The stock price for CBS is up 54% year-to-date. “Floyd has brought immense amount of value to sports and the network as a whole,” says Espinoza.  
For all the strides Showtime has made in boxing, HBO is still a formidable opponent. Thanks in part to its lead in subscribers, HBO broadcast  nine of the top 10 live fights  on cable television in 2013 and has 40 years of boxing history to fall back on. Yet the champ is stumbling after getting crushed on PPV buys and with average ratings for championship bouts below one million for the first time in years. The fight will continue in 2014 inside and outside the ring.
