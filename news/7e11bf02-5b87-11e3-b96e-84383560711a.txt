The holiday’s are here, which means it is the time for parties! Although fun, picking out your perfect party ensemble can be a challenge, especially when it’s your company’s holiday party. Some offices are slightly more conservative, and some more laid back, so here are two types of outfits that should get you through any office setting in style and with plenty of holiday cheer.  
 
 
  
   
   
 
 
  You can’t go wrong with a great tuxedo blazer and a structured pair of trousers, especially if your company is a little more conservative. To make this look more fun and holiday appropriate, add a pop of print or color and shiny metallic accessories.  
   
   
  Saint Laurent Leather Trimmed Tuxedo Blazer $2,890 ,  Mango Cropped Trousers $50 ,  Emilio Pucci Wool   Silk Tuxedo Jacket $1,772 ,  Erickson Beamon Earrings $480 ,  Miss Selfridge Metallic Pump $57  
     
 
 
 
  
   
   
 

  
 
 
  A little bit of shimmer is always appropriate for the holidays, which is why I love embellished skirts. They are dressy and fun, and will work for most office environments. Add a motorcycle jacket for an edgier look, or a feminine blouse for a more classic look.  
   
  Monsoon Sequin Scallop Skirt $175 ,  Rick Owens Cashmere Sweater $487 ,  Inde y Vides Onyx Necklace $450 ,  Jonathan Simkhai Metallic Boucle Skirt $465 ,  Mango Bow Blouse $46 ,  Bauble Bar Crystal Earrings $32 ,  Zara Leather Pumps $79
