WASHINGTON  Dec 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on
Friday agreed to weigh whether Fifth Third Bancorp can
be sued for putting company stock in its employee retirement
plan ahead of the housing downturn. 
The court will consider a lawsuit filed by two employees,
John Dudenhoeffer and Alireza Partovipanah, who alleged that the
bank and officers in charge, including its president and CEO,
Kevin Kabat, violated their fiduciary duties.
