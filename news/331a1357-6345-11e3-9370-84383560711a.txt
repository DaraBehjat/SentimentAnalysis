There are no secrets on the internet anymore, and video game projects trying to be kept under wraps have a way of being uncovered far ahead of their official reveal date these days. Such is the case with Fallout 4 today, a game, that  according to Kotaku at least , actually exists.  
The internet recently had their hopes and dreams crushed when a viral site called TheSurvivor2099 appeared online with a countdown timer. In the end, it counted down to nothing more than  Rick Roll , leaving fans saddened and despondent.  
But now, Kotaku has revealed that they’ve gotten their hands on official casting documents for a project codenamed “Institute.” They’re pieces of scripts used to cast various characters in a game, including male and female protagonist.  
According to the info, that game is Fallout 4, and the new installment will be set in Boston, which jives with reports that Bethesda was scouting MIT as a game location in 2012. You can read some of the scripts  here  for yourself, which highlights a few characters that may or may not have been invented purely for the casting call. Most notable, an engineer named Sturges is described as a cross between “Buddy Holly and Vin Diesel.” Vin Diesel likes games, they should just get him to do it.  
The Commonwealth, which exists in what’s left of Massachusetts after the nuclear war, has been alluded to in other Fallout games, but never actually seen. It’s interesting to have a game set in Boston, which often doesn’t see too much action in the post-apocalypse across movies, TV or games. Though I suppose New York, DC and LA have been done to death, no pun intended. The series really seems determined not to leave America, even when there might be more interesting international cities out there they could be using.  
Despite the limited info, I think I’m most excited about the apparent fact that the protagonist will actually have a voice this time around. Having two sides of a conversation dramatically increases engagement in a game, and allows the protagonist to actually be a real character, rather than just a blank slate. See Mass Effect’s Shepard vs. Fallout 3′s…uh, what was my name again?  
Fallout 4 is coming, someday, that much was obvious even before today. It’s just a matter of declaring whether this is the official confirmation or not, and I don’t think this one is going to turn out to be a hoax. I trust Kotaku when they say they’ve confirmed these are real casting documents, and the information lines up with enough previous rumblings to seem legitimate. New Vegas came out in 2010, and we’re heading into 2014 now. I’d guess we may see the game for the fall of 2015 at its current stage of development, and I think I can speak for all of us when I say I can’t wait to see what the world of Fallout will look like on next gen consoles. Yes, you can mod the PC version with new textures to kingdom come, but I have a hunch Bethesda will be going all out, and the experience will be like nothing we’ve ever seen.
