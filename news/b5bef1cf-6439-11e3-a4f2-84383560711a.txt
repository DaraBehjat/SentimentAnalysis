It’s certainly “market” in the world we live in today and reflects Nasdaq multiples.  
Palantir is apparently doing $1b in bookings and growing at   40% YoY. That’s pretty epic, valuation aside. They are killing it.  It’s very hard for an enterprise company to be accelerating at that rate, at that scale.  
The valuation at 9x ’14 revenues is pretty high, but not inconsistent with the best SaaS/B2B companies.  
An open question is the margins and the “quality” of their revenue. How much is services, vs. pure software? Traditionally, services are valued at 1/5th to 1/10th of true recurring revenue. So long as the services component is ≤ 1/3 of their revenue, the multiple should be consistent with the SaaS peer set. If Palantir is really a services business, though, that is also delivering some semi-custom software (vs. a software company that also sells some professional services to implement that software) … the multiple may not be deserved.  
We’ll see the ratio in the S-1.
