Dec 1 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is testing
delivery packages using drones, CEO Jeff Bezos said Sunday on
the CBS television program "60 Minutes." 
Bezos said the drones, unmanned vehicles that fly through
the air, could deliver packages that weigh up to five pounds
(2.3 kg). That represents roughly 86 percent of packages that
Amazon delivers, he said. The drones, which would pick up items from Amazon's
distribution centers and fly them to customer's homes, probably 
won't be put into use for four or five years, Bezos said.
