The November NPD report  came out yesterday , and though it lacks any actual numbers for console sales, or really very much relevancy at all, reporting only retail sales in this digital age, it seems as good a time as any to state a fact that has been clear for quite some time now.  
It’s a great time to be a gamer, and it’s a great time to be making video game consoles. Everyone is winning this new console generation.  
Yes, we’ve all engaged in talk of this console “war,”  myself included , and it’s fun to see  Microsoft   Microsoft  and  Sony   Sony  duke it out trying to spin the best PR for each of their systems’ milestones. But really, it’s an easy job. It’s all good news at this point.  
Sony is outselling Microsoft, but barely, and likely because the system has been out a tad longer. Microsoft is selling more quickly, but still lacks the total numbers to declare “victory.” But really, both companies have demolished every sales record in existence, to the point where no other past console launch comes close.  
Both the PS4 and the Xbox One sold a million units in 24 hours. Last we heard, Sony was at around 2.1M total units sold while the Xbox was at 2M. All of these figures are simply astonishing, and though one may have a small edge on the other, the “war” isn’t meaningful. Rather than two sides duking it out and bloodying each other, waiting for a victor to emerge, it’s more a like a dinner date, where both sides are eating until they’re stuffed, and arguing about who downed a more impressive meal.  
Normally I’d turn and start wagging my finger at  Nintendo   Nintendo , as the Wii U is obviously far behind its competitors who have sold half the console’s lifetime sales in just a few weeks. I recently  wrote a column  about how Nintendo may want to consider exiting the home console game, but I have to remain positive about them as well. Nintendo has released some of the most highly rated games of the year, Mario, Zelda and Pokemon titles across the Wii U and 3DS. Their handhelds are selling very well, and all their systems will get a much needed Christmas boost as cheaper alternative to Xbox One and PS4. They have great 2014 titles on the horizon from Smash Bros. to Mario Kart, and though they have their home console challenges, they’re in a much better position than they were a year or two ago.  
The industry has simply grown to the point where there are plenty of customers to go around. This battle between Sony and Microsoft isn’t a slugfest, it’s more of a pillowfight at this point. Or perhaps they’re swinging sacks of money at each other.  
So far, this console launch has played out the way many expected. Both systems set records, and while Sony may have a small edge due to Microsoft’s pre-launch issues and the general love for PlayStation outside the US, it’s incredibly close and the gap between the two really isn’t meaningful at this point.  
And honestly, both systems have so few must-have exclusives out right now, you can almost buy your child/friend/brother/sister/parent/husband/wife either the Xbox One or the PS4, and still have them be able to play the best games on the market from Assassin’s Creed 4, to Call of Duty: Ghosts, to Need for Speed Rivals. Once games like Infamous and Titanfall and Uncharted and Halo come out, the battlelines will be more clearly drawn, but now? Killzone vs. Dead Rising or Knack vs. Ryse aren’t exactly gripping head-to-head match-ups.  
In the end, the two systems are very, very similar, give or take a Kinect here, $100 there. They have far less in common with the Wii U, gaming tablets, the forthcoming Steam Box, the Oculus Rift, and of course, the PC, hence why it’s really no surprise they’re selling more or less equally. Both are powerful boxes that have a some decent launch games and function well as a media hub. The rest is just details, and so far, most of those details don’t matter.  
Once more exclusives are released, the divide will grow wider, but again, we’ll likely settle into a 360 vs. PS3 situation, where both consoles physically just aren’t all that different from one another. Only this time, instead of the Wii destroying both systems with its sales, it will likely be Sony and Microsoft splitting big numbers between them, with Nintendo playing catch up. But I have a feeling the landscape will change dramatically as new players enter the scene.  
For now, all is well, no matter what brand you support. Buy a system this Christmas, and enjoy it.
