                      comments       No, Virginia. There is no Santa Claus rally   By CNNMoney Staff   @CNNMoneyInvest     December 12, 2013: 10:25 AM ET               Click here for more market data.           NEW YORK (CNNMoney)    Stocks fell Thursday as investors watched some high profile initial public offerings and looked for clues as to when the Federal Reserve will wind down its bond buying program.    The  Dow Jones Industrial Average , the  S P 500  and the  Nasdaq  were down in mid-morning trading.

      Stocks  dropped sharply Wednesday as investors worried that a new U.S. budget deal raised the chance that the Federal Reserve might start to scale back its support for the economy soon. And investors continued to focus on economic data Thursday in an attempt to gauge the Fed's sentiment ahead of its policy meeting next week.     The Department of Labor said initial jobless claims rose to 368,000 last week, higher than what economists were expecting.     Retail sales ticked up from the previous month, according to the Census Bureau, slightly beating Wall Street estimates.     Stocks often enjoy a nice rally in December but after a record-breaking run for the Dow and S P 500, the so-called Santa Claus rally has yet to materialize. The S P 500 has fallen 1.5% so far this month.     In another sign that December may not deliver strong returns, CNNMoney's  Fear and Greed index , which tracks the  VIX   ( VIX )  and six other gauges of market sentiment, slipped into Fear territory. It was in Greed mode just a week ago.      See also: Will the market actually cheer tapering?

Shares of  Lululemon   ( LULU )  tanked more than 10% after the yogawear producer reported earnings and revenue that beat forecasts, but  dimmed its outlook .      Facebook   ( FB ,  Fortune 500 )  bounced 3% after Standard   Poor's  announced  late Wednesday that the social networking giant will be added to its benchmark S P 500 index later this month.      European markets  were mixed to slightly weaker in morning trading. while  Asian markets  ended lower.               First Published: December 12, 2013: 9:52 AM ET
