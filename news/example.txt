                      comments       JPMorgan agrees to $13 billion mortgage settlement   By James O'Toole and Evan Perez   @CNNMoneyInvest     November 19, 2013: 3:47 PM ET               JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon hasn't had a lot to smile about this year.         NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   JPMorgan has agreed to a $13 billion settlement over mortgage-backed securities sold ahead of the financial crisis, officials announced Tuesday.    The Justice Department called the agreement "the largest settlement with a single entity in American history."

     At issue are allegations that JPMorgan and firms it later purchased, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, sold risky mortgage securities during the housing bubble while misrepresenting their quality. These securities later failed in huge numbers, playing a key role in the 2008 crisis.     As part of the agreement, JPMorgan admitted to making "serious misrepresentations" to investors in mortgage-backed securities, the Justice Department said.     JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement the firm was "pleased to have concluded this extensive agreement." The company said it would continue to cooperate with authorities.     "Without a doubt, the conduct uncovered in this investigation helped sow the seeds of the mortgage meltdown," Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement.     The $13 billion figure includes a $4 billion settlement  announced last month  by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which has overseen government-backed housing finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since their 2008 bailout. JPMorgan agreed to pay $4 billion to resolve securities fraud claims and another $1.1 billion to repurchase mortgages sold to Fannie and Freddie.     Fannie and Freddie purchased billions of dollars' worth of mortgage-backed securities ahead of the crisis and required a government rescue in 2008 when those investments soured.

Attorneys general from California and New York have also been involved in the talks.     Some $4 billion of the settlement has been earmarked to help consumers. This total includes $2 billion to be used for principal reductions for borrowers, and $2 billion worth of other assistance, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said.     This assistance includes loan refinancing, donation of bank-owned properties, and new mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income families harmed by the crisis.     An independent monitor will keep an eye on the bank to ensure compliance.     The settlement does not address the question of whether any individual bankers engaged in criminal wrongdoing. There is an ongoing federal probe on this issue in California with which JPMorgan has agreed to cooperate.     Other banks will likely be on the hook for similar settlements. Holder said Tuesday that JPMorgan "was not the only financial institution during this period to knowingly bundle toxic loans and sell them to unsuspecting investors."      JPMorgan   ( JPM ,  Fortune 500 )  was just one of 18 financial institutions  FHFA sued  in 2011, accusing them of selling Fannie and Freddie securities that "had different and more risky characteristics than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales materials."     The Justice Department, meanwhile, is reportedly  looking to use  the expected settlement with JPMorgan as a template for deals with other financial institutions suspected of engaging in similar tactics during the housing bubble.      Related: Probe looks at JPMorgan hiring practices in China      The case is the latest in a series of legal headaches for JPMorgan, the country's largest bank by assets.     Last week, JPMorgan announced  a $4.5 billion settlement  with institutional investors who suffered losses on bubble-era mortgage securities. The firm has  paid over $1 billion in fines  in connection with last year's "London Whale" trading debacle, and $80 million more over alleged  unfair credit card billing practices .     In July, the bank agreed to pay $410 million to settle  charges that it manipulated electricity prices  in California and the Midwest. It is also facing scrutiny over its hiring practices in China and its alleged involvement in the Libor rate-fixing scandal.     JPMorgan posted a loss for the third quarter  based on its massive legal expenses . Dimon called the loss "painful" and warned that litigation costs could continue to be a drag on earnings for several quarters.     The bank said at the time that it was holding $23 billion in reserve for potential litigation expenses, but that its legal costs could be nearly $6 billion more than that in a worst-case scenario.     While JPMorgan is shelling out a staggering amount of money, the bank is large enough to absorb the costs. It booked $21.3 billion in net income for 2012, and has assets of $2.5 trillion.               First Published: November 19, 2013: 2:22 PM ET
