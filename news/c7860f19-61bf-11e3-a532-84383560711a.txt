* General Motors names first female CEO 
* Lululemon falls as retailer names new CEO, founder steps
down * Twitter rallies to new high * Indexes: Dow down 0.2 pct; S  down 0.2 pct; Nasdaq flat By Angela Moon NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were modestly lower
on Tuesday on profit-taking after the S  500 index climbed to a
record in the prior session and on caution the Federal Reserve
may end its stimulus sooner than expected. General Motors Co was in the spotlight after the
automaker said Chief Executive Dan Akerson will step down next
month and be replaced by Mary Barra, the company's global
product development chief. The stock was flat at
$40.94. A number of U.S. policymakers suggested on Monday the U.S.
central bank may be closer than previously thought to trimming
its $85 billion a month in bond purchases. But the market
managed to end higher, with the S  500 closing at a record. "You have to be impressed at how resilient and how the
market has absorbed taper talks," said Dan Veru, chief
investment officer at Palisade Capital Management. "I do think there has been a bit of ongoing profit taking
due to the underlying distrust of this stock market rally." The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.18 points or
0.23 percent, to 15,988.35, the S  500 lost 3.79 points
or 0.21 percent, to 1,804.58 and the Nasdaq Composite 
dropped 2.798 points or 0.07 percent, to 4,065.953. A budget deal could emerge in Congress on Tuesday aimed at
avoiding a U.S. government shutdown on Jan. 15 and relieving
federal agencies of some indiscriminate spending cuts,
congressional aides said on Monday. High-end yoga-wear retailer Lululemon Athletica Inc 
named Laurent Potdevin as its chief executive and said founder
Chip Wilson will step down as non-executive chairman. The stock
fell 0.3 percent to $70.11. Twitter shares hit an all-time high of $52.58,
extending Monday's gains after a spate of product announcements
that could boost its revenue prospects. Shares of Rambus Inc jumped 17 percent to $10.01
after settling a patent dispute with Micron Technology. The United States will not implement the so-called Volcker
rule before 2015, a widely expected move after regulators
struggled for years to agree on the ban on proprietary trading,
a top regulator said on Tuesday.
