                       Football dominated the list of Twitter  surges  among users in 2013, the social network has revealed. 
         Real Madrid knocking Manchester United out of the Champions League caused the biggest spike among its UK-based users during the year. 
         Other popular moments were Andy Murray s Wimbledon win, Mumford   Sons at Glastonbury, and New Year s Eve. 
         But when it came to retweets, it was the boys from pop band One Direction who stood out. 
         Three of the top five most retweeted messages were from the group, with  Yesss ! I m 20 ! Wohooo ! No more teens!  from band member Niall being shared 375,000 times. 
         Yet the two most popular retweets worldwide were not about celebration, but tragedy. 
         Glee star Lea Michele  thanked fans for their messages of support  and condolence after the death of co-star and real-life partner Cory Monteith - a message that was shared 408,000 times. 
         And more recently, a  post confirming the death of Fast and the Furious star Paul Walker  drew 400,000 retweets. 
   Great goals 
	       As Twitter enters 2014 as a publicly owned company, much of its strategy for generating profit will centre on being the  second screen  app of choice - that is, being the place people go to to chat and read about major events as they unfold, either in real life or, most often, on television. 
         This theory was evident in 2013, with armchair sports fans causing eight of the 10 biggest  tweet surges  in the UK. 
   
   

     Glee s Lea Michele had the year s most retweeted post 
   
       With the exception of Andy Murray s tennis triumph, all were about football. 
         Football dominated the most-tweeted-about moments in terms of tweets-per-second,  said Lewis Wiltshire, head of media partnerships at Twitter UK.  
         The natural way you react when you see a great goal is to grab your phone. 
   Abusive tweets 
	       Excited chatter aside, Twitter s year will also be remembered for less positive reasons. 
         Trolling  on the platform is on the rise, police say, while high-profile instances of bullying also made the headlines.

		 Stella Creasy and Toby Young debate how best to deal with Twitter trolls 
		 
    
		




       MP Stella Creasy was among those who received death threats and sexually explicit abuse on Twitter. Others, like academic Mary Beard, were sent bomb threats. 
         There are more than 500 million tweets a day on Twitter,  said Mr Wiltshire.  
         The overwhelming number are positive. There ll always be one or two people want to highlight.
