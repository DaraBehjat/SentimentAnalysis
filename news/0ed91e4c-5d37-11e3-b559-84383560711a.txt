     Kozlowski  received a sentence  of 8-1/3 to 25 years in prison in one of the highest-profile corporate fraud cases of the new millennium. He  spent lavishly  with the stolen funds, infamously dropping $6,000 alone on a shower curtain and $2 million on a "Roman orgy" party in Sardinia featuring an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David urinating vodka.     Kozlowski started his sentence at a medium-security prison in upstate New York, where he was  reportedly dubbed "Koz"  by rapper and fellow inmate Ja Rule. He has since been on work release with an e-learning company, held at Manhattan's Lincoln Correctional Facility with  the opportunity  to leave on some evenings.

Kozlowski is tentatively set to be released on January 17.     "Mr. Kozlowski is grateful to the parole board for its decision to grant him parole," his lawyer, Alan Lewis, said Tuesday.     Kozlowski's first parole bid was  denied  last year, prompting him to sue challenging the decision.               First Published: December 3, 2013: 7:18 PM ET
