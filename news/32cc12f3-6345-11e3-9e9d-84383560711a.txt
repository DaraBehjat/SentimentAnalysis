Answer  by  Jason M. Lemkin ,  Managing  Director, Storm Ventures   ceo/co-founder @ EchoSign, acquired by Adobe, acquired by Adobe, on  Quora ,

Let me throw out a framework I’ve used. It works particularly well in recurring revenue models, where each extra dollar beyond your goals is worth so much, because SaaS compounds:  
 
  Each year, figure out whatever your plan will be for the year. Make sure everyone knows it, all year long.  
  If you exceed the plan, pay out 5-10% of the “overage” (maybe 20-25% in the early days, at your stage) to your employees.  
  E.g., If you hit $1m this year, and had planned to hit say $800k … take a piece of that success, that “extra” $200k … and pay it back.  
 
That takes all the stress out of things. If you exceed expectations as a team, everyone should share in that success in a start-up. Period. IMHO.  
——  
Beyond that, I believe every truly key employee should get an additional grant every year when you are small … and every almost great employee should get one every two years when you are small … so they always have a lot of options still vesting.  
This question  originally appeared  on  Quora . More questions on  Entrepreneurship :  
 
  What’s the #1 reason why tech startups fail?    
  How can an outsider figure out how well a startup is doing?  
  What were the most ridiculous startup ideas that eventually became successful?
