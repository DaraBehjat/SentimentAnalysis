WASHINGTON  Dec 10 (Reuters) - Democratic Representative Mel
Watt's nomination to lead the agency that regulates
taxpayer-owned mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac cleared a procedural hurdle in the U.S.
Senate, putting it on course for final approval likely later on
Tuesday. 
President Barack Obama nominated Watt in May to head the
Federal Housing Finance Agency, but Republicans had blocked a
final vote. Last month, however, Senate Democrats changed the
rules to allow nominees like Watt to overcome filibusters with a
simple majority in the 100-seat chamber. Previously, it took 60 votes. Democrats control the chamber
55-45.
