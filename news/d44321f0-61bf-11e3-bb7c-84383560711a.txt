NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   Stocks fell Tuesday as investors hit the pause button a day after the S P 500 closed at yet another record high.    The  Dow ,  S P 500  and  Nasdaq  slipped slightly. But this year has been a strong one for stocks, with all three indexes up more than 20% so far. But investors are wary to make big bets ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, when it will decide whether to continue pumping money into the economy at its current rate of $85 billion a month.

The U.S. government  revealed Monday t hat it had sold the last of its stake in the automaker.      Lululemon   ( LULU )  shares gained ground after the yoga retailer announced that  Laurent Potdevin will become CEO  of the company in January, replacing outgoing CEO Christine Day. Potdevin had been the president of shoe company TOMS. Lululemon also said founder Chip Wilson will step down as chairman in the spring. Lululemon struggled through several very public product recalls this year.     Some traders on StockTwits were pleased with the news.     " $LULU  appointed Laurent Potdevin as CEO, previously President of TOMS Shoes," said  Cow . ":Good choice. Upgrades coming. Short squeeze to $80. Bullish."     But most were skeptical of the move.     " $LULU  lets not get to excited, New CEO Cannot Save Lululemon," said  Trader_m3 . "The glory dayz are over."     Given that Lululemon reports earnings on Thursday, the timing of the move was particularly concerning.     " $LULU  anyone shorting this here? asked  scottsdalem . "It's suspicious when a new CEO is announced just 2 days before the ER. Rushing???"      Twitter   ( TWTR )  shares hit an all-time high above $52 per share.

But most were wary of Twitter's big jump.     " TWTR  has reached unsustainable levels," said  goprules . "Expect correction   profit taking soon."     Though there wasn't any clear news driving up shares of Twitter, some traders cited rumors that Carl Icahn, who has had a great year in part due to his investment in Netflix, is buying Twitter shares.     " TWTR  So all the excitement is about Uncle Icahn trying to inflate this one like  $NFLX ? hmmmm....." said  Silence .

Bank of America   ( BAC ,  Fortune 500 )  shares were flat.     On the earnings front,  Toll Brothers    ( TOL ) were mostly unchanged even though the homebuilder topped profit and revenue estimates.     Gun maker  Smith   Wesson   ( SWHC )  is scheduled to release quarterly results after the closing bell. The company, as well as rival gun maker  Sturm, Ruger   ( RGR ) , have  surged this year  as calls for stricter gun control laws of have started to wane in the year since the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Conn.
