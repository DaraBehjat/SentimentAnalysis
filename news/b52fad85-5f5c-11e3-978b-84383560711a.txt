                       The electric guitar played by Bob Dylan at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival has been sold at auction in New York for a record $965,000 (Â£591,000). 
         The Fender Stratocaster had been in the possession of a New Jersey family for 48 years after he left it on a plane. 
         The pilot s daughter had it authenticated on a television programme on US broadcaster PBS. 
         The festival in Newport, Rhode Island, is often cited as the performance where Dylan  went electric . 
         Dylan s move  changed the structure of folk music , Newport Folk Festival founder George Wein, 88, told the Associated Press news agency. 
         The minute Dylan went electric, all these young people said,  Bobby s going electric. We re going electric, too. 
         But at the time, the three-song set drew boos from the crowd, who had come expecting Dylan s traditional acoustic folk performance. 
         Dawn Peterson said on the PBS programme History Detectives that her father, the private plane s pilot, asked Dylan s management firm what to do with the guitar but nobody ever got back to him.  
         Experts matched the wood grain on the instrument with a close-up colour photo taken during Dylan s set at the festival. 
         Recently, Dylan and Ms Peterson quietly settled a legal dispute over the instrument. Details of the settlement are not known. 
         Auction house Christie s had estimated the guitar would sell for $300,000-$500,000. The buyer has not been identified. 
         The previous record for a guitar sold at auction was a Fender owned by Eric Clapton, nicknamed  Blackie , which sold at Christie s for $959,500 in 2004.
