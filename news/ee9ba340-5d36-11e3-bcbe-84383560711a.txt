   Michael Bristow, Arca Biopharma President and CEO 
 
Arca Biopharma today  announced  that it had received FDA clearance to start a phase 2B/3 trial of its novel beta-blocker, Gencaro (bucindolol) for the prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure. The GENETIC-AF trial has all the hallmarks of the modern era: the drug will only be tested in patients with a genetic variation that the company believes may predict a positive response to the drug. And the trial will be one of the first to utilize the much-discussed “adaptive” trial design, starting as a phase 2B study and then possibly expanding to a phase 3 study after an interim analysis of the trial data.  
But if GENETIC-AF represents the very model of a modern drug, it also serves as a good example of the pitfalls of drug development. Because this drug has been around for a very long time and has had a very troubled history.  
Back in the early 1990s, bucindolol was originally developed by Bristol Myers as a beta-blocker with unique properties. Around the same time beta-blockers were first being explored as a revolutionary new therapy for heart failure (they are now recognized as standard therapy). bucindolol’s unique properties were thought to be potentially advantageous in heart failure and the drug was tested in BEST, a large NIH-sponsored trial. But high hopes for the drug largely vanished in 2001 when  the BEST results were published . Unlike other beta-blockers tested around the same time, bucindolol had not been found to improve mortality.  
Some investigators remained convinced that bucindolol was worth salvaging, though Bristol Myers dropped its involvement and support. A subgroup analysis from BEST suggested that the drug may have had a beneficial effect in non-black patients. This led to additional research. Eventually,  a genetic substudy from BEST  found a variation in the β1-adrenergic receptor that appeared to identify heart failure patients who would benefit from bucindolol.  
One BEST investigator and bucindolol champion, cardiologist Michael Bristow, then formed Arca to develop bucindolol based on this finding. ”We think this is one of those examples where pharmacogenetics could resurrect a drug,”  said  another of the investigators. “I think we are heading toward the personalized medicine goal that people keep talking about.”  
But once again early hopes were dashed. The company submitted an NDA based on the BEST trial and the pharmacogenomic study but in 2009 received  a complete response letter from the FDA .  
Now the company is going to try once again. The company has identified a new strategy for the drug. Research in recent years has found that heart failure patients with AF don’t receive the usual benefits from beta blockers and the company believes that bucindolol may help prevent the development of AF in this population. GENETIC-AF, which will be performed by the Duke Clinical Research Organization, is designed to test this hypothesis. The trial will begin enrolling patients early next year. In the first phase 2B portion of the study, 200 patients with the genetic variation identified by the company will be randomized to bucindolol or another beta-blocker, metroprolol. After an interim analysis by the trial’s Data Safety Monitoring Board the trial may be expanded into a phase 3 trial and enroll an additional 420 patients.  
After more than 20 years of wandering in the wilderness will bucindolol finally find the land of milk and honey? Will genetic testing and an adaptive trial design do the trick? There’s no way to know until the trial is done, but caution is warranted. Previous efforts to bring genetic testing into clinical cardiology– most notably, to help  choose antiplatelet drugs  and, more recently,  the best dose  of the anticoagulant warfarin– have not been successful.  
If GENETIC-AF is successful then it will be an early triumph for personalized medicine. But the history of this drug suggests that it may be an uphill battle. Milton Packer, one of the pioneers of the use of beta-blockers in heart failure, told me that he thought the “chances of this working are really really small.”
