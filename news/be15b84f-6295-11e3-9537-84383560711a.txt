Yayyyyyy.  You can hear the groan, like a chorus of underwhelmed kids at Christmas.  A budget deeealll.   
Why the long face? Congress is working!  
Ben Domenech splashes some cold water at The Transom:  

  It’s not a budget resolution, so there’s still no budget. And it replaces the sequester with new spending cuts! Well, not really. It’s mostly about shifting a portion of the real defense-focused cuts of the sequester to a bunch of fake cuts in government spending. And it does it without raising taxes! Well, not really. Unless you think broad-based user fees which aren’t actually tied to the costs of anything in particular can be called anything but a tax. And it does it while reducing the deficit! Well, not really. Only if you trust politicians ten years from now to honor caps that today’s politicians won’t. Okay, but at least we avoided another crisis in Washington – maybe this spells a new dawn of bipartisanship! Well, not really. Because it’s not a budget resolution, there’s no reconciliation instructions for the next debt ceiling increase. This is a “we want to be home for Christmas” deal, nothing more. 
 
Oh. That.  
So why is the deal earning nods from influential commentators across the right of center?  The Weekly Standard ‘s Bill Kristol  says  it’s “a small but significant step toward strengthening our national defense, and should help produce a Republican and conservative electoral victory in November.” At  National Review , Yuval Levin is a bit more cautious,  but still pretty bold : “That the Democrats would accept a deal like this is a pretty striking indication of how the Republican House has changed the conversation on the spending front since 2010.”  
In fact, although Yuval belittles the scope of the deal on its face, he underscores why the stakes are so high for Republicans to treat this deal like a good one. And in so doing, he sheds more than a little light on why so many people are ready to tune out on the whole question of the budget.  
Consider first Ben’s rather renegade suggestion that the budget deal went down as it did “because there are enough Republicans on Capitol Hill who still wouldn’t vote to comply with sequester spending levels.” Yuval gestures toward that problem, but for him, it doesn’t define reality on the Hill. “There’s not much to celebrate here, and there won’t be until the Democrats no longer control the Senate and the White House,” he writes; “but there’s not much to bemoan either, and this deal would make it more likely that the Democrats will lose that control.” In short:  Republicans — and everyone, I guess — have to embrace this budget, because as long as Democrats are in power, this is about as good as it’s going to get.  
That’s not just a plausible answer for reform-minded establishment conservatives. It’s the  only  answer, because this sort of patience — this head-down process governing devoted to eyeshades and sharpened pencils until the electoral tide finally turns — is, from their standpoint, the only way get get to the finish line.  
And what’s the finish line? Yuval:  

  The goal of conservatives in national politics can’t just be to have less of the same: the liberal welfare state at a slightly lower cost. That is basically what a sequester approach to the budget amounts to, after all—no reform of anything, just a small bit of across the board spending pressure. The goal, rather, should be to transform American government along conservative lines, into a government that works to sustain and expand the space between the individual and the state, to strengthen the market economy and make its benefits accessible to more Americans, to help the poor not with an empty promise of material equality but with a fervent commitment to upward mobility, to strengthen the middle class by lifting needless burdens off the shoulders of parents and workers, and to put an end to the cronyism and corporatism that have come increasingly to characterize the relationship between the private and public sectors. 
 
Okay, okay, great. If you agree. And even if huge majorities of Americans aren’t exactly thrilled about the generic conservative program, or what they imagine it to be,  vast  majorities are pretty much decided that transformational change — radical, fundamental reform — is  not  coming to Washington, not this Christmas, not next year, not ever. That’s the sensation that’s got people tuning out on a national scale.  
And, sadly, it’s a sensation that none of the careful endorsements coming from the responsible right can do much to dispel.  
Why not? Because the assumption that leads them to make their endorsement is flatly partisan: so long as you have  x  amount of Democrats, transformational, fundamental reform is impossible. Period. Once you accept that, as a Republican, you get to Paul Ryan Land pretty quickly (if you haven’t been there for years already).  
But we  know from months-old experience  that this just isn’t true. We know that the likes of  Justin Amash  in the House and  Rand Paul  in the Senate have opened the door on rough but ready cross-party coalitions dedicated to radical reform. We have a powerful Senate Democrat now  quoting  James Madison  on  tyranny , for heaven’s sake!  
Yet not a peep about this from the responsible reformers, presumably because it blows a hole in this idea that you’ve got to bite the bullet and work with establishment Dems in order to trudge toward victory. How’s that for a conceptual schema virtually guaranteed to foreclose an awareness of transformational opportunities?  
And hey, believe me: If the trust-building and momentum-building and conversation-changing potential of working with the Wyden left on transformational reform was simply a pipe dream, I wouldn’t belabor the point. But it’s  not  a pipe dream — it’s a  real possibility  that  millions  of regular Americans are crying out for — when they’re not too jaded, exhausted, and narcotized to try.  
Whatever the merits of this budget deal, from the standpoint of Americans asking the commentariat to wake them up when the character of their hideous regime transforms, it amounts to a colossal WHO CARES?  
Instead of making fun of them or tuning them out right back, we all ought to ask back: AND WHY NOT?
