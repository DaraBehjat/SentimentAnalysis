Dec 10 (Reuters) - Shares of Scripps Networks Interactive
 soared more than 11 percent after the market closed on
Tuesday on a news report that Discovery Communications 
is considering a bid for the sought-after cable company. 
Discovery's board discussed making a possible run at
Scripps, home to the Food Network and HGTV, according to a
report in Variety citing a person with knowledge of the
Discovery board meeting. A spokeswoman for Discovery was not immediately available to
comment. A spokesman for Scripps Networks declined to comment. Discovery is the company behind the OWN Network and Animal
Planet. On the distribution side, the cable industry has been a
hotbed of potential merger activity. The latest target is Time
Warner Cable which is being circled by competitors
Comcast and Charter. Shares of Scripps closed at $75.25 on Tuesday.
