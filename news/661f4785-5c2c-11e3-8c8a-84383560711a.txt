     Stocks opened lower Tuesday, with the  Dow ,  S P 500  and  Nasdaq  slipping in early trading.     The S P has managed gains in December for 24 of the past 30 years, but with the index up 27% so far in 2013 investors are ready to take a break.     "It's likely that markets will be in a holding pattern as we head into the business end of the week that starts with ADP employment tomorrow, the ECB on Thursday and ending with payrolls on Friday," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid, in a market report.      U.S. stocks  also declined Monday as  disappointing Black Friday sales  weighed on retailers, and an upbeat manufacturing report revived talk that the Federal Reserve could begin scaling back its massive stimulus program as early as this month.      Related: Fear   Greed Index gets greedy      Friday brings the release of the monthly jobs report which investors hope will send a much clearer signal as to the likely next move by the Fed.     There's little corporate or economic news expected Tuesday.  Ford   ( F ,  Fortune 500 ) ,  General Motors   ( GM ,  Fortune 500 )  and other major automakers will release their monthly sales figures over the course of the day.     In other company news,  Sony   ( SNE )  said that it  sold 2.1 million Playstation 4s  worldwide as of Dec. 1.      European markets  were outpacing Wall Street losses with dismal morning trading. France's  CAC 40  down almost 2%.      Asian markets  ended mixed, with Japan's Nikkei advancing 0.6% as the yen weakened. Shares in Shanghai joined the rally, adding 0.6% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined by 0.5%.               First Published: December 3, 2013: 9:41 AM ET
