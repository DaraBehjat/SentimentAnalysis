     At the same time, colleges across the country have been  hiking tuition  and fees and families'  incomes have been shrinking , student loan debt has risen at an average rate of 6% per year from 2008 to 2012, the report found.

To make matters worse, the job market still hasn't recovered, leaving many graduates with little or no income.     vidConfig.push({ videoArray : [ {id : "/video/news/2013/09/03/n-cost-of-college-rising-education-middle-class-jobs.cnnmoney", hed: "Is the cost of college crippling?"} ], playerprofile : 'story', playerid : 'cvp_0', divid : 'vid0', hedtarget : '#cnnplayer0 .cnnHeadline' });                    Is the cost of college crippling?

So it's important to shop around before shelling out your life savings for an education. Average debt by college ranged from as little as $4,450 to $49,450 in 2012, while the percentage of students with loans also varied from 6% to 100%, TICAS found.     "Despite discouraging headlines, a college degree remains the best route to finding a job in this tight market. But students and families need to know that debt levels can vary widely from college to college," TICAS president Lauren Asher said in a statement.
