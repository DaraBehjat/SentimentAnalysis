For two years, Washington has been asking whether or how another 1986-style tax reform might be accomplished. Whatever happened to 1995-style tax reform? That year, Republicans gained control of both the House and Senate. Rep. Bill Archer, who took over the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee, was deeply committed to “tearing the income tax system out by its roots” and starting over.  
In June 1995 the Ways and Means Committee held hearings on proposals to replace the income tax. They included the flat tax, introduced by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, the USA tax, introduced by Sens. Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici, and a national retail sales tax. The proposals shared an important feature: They strongly favored investment. Each would have provided for expensing of capital investments made by businesses and tax exemption for personal savings. The flat tax and the national retail sales tax also promised rates much lower than the top income tax rate. In summary, the tax reform vision of 1995 was a combination of low rates, expensing, and exemption for investment income. Congress failed to deliver on that vision.  
The recent Finance Committee discussion drafts on cost recovery and accounting methods, which are reflective of the latest tax reform rhetoric, demonstrate vividly that “tax reform” has been reduced to the pursuit of lower rates and that any benefit for capital-intensive businesses or investors will have to be found implicitly in that lower rate rather than in the treatment of capital.  
Whether the 1986 experience can be repeated is open to question. Indeed, responses to the recent Finance Committee discussion drafts and the House Republicans’ decision to delay tax reform suggest that the inability to achieve the reform witnessed in 1986 is the more likely outcome. What is certain is that the 1995 hope of creating a tax system that genuinely favors savings and investment is dead.
