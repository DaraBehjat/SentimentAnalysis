     Congressional negotiators reached a  bipartisan budget compromise  on Tuesday that would prevent another government shutdown, if approved by the House and Senate. The deal would set spending levels, reduce the deficit and relieve some of the arbitrary, forced spending cuts.     The reduced risk of a damaging shutdown would give support to those arguing for the Fed to begin trimming its $85-billion a month bond purchases as early as next week.     "They could well be helped in this decision by last night's announcement... that a new budget deal could well be unveiled in the coming days," noted Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.     "It certainly does appear that a window of opportunity could be opening up for the Fed to act next week without a sharp market reaction, the only question remaining as to whether they will avail themselves of it."
