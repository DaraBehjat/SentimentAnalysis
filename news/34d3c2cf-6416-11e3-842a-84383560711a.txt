FORT WORTH, Texas  Dec 13 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp
 still expects to deliver 36 F-35 fighter jets from its
facility in Fort Worth, Texas, this year despite a five-day halt
in flights due to bad weather this week, the company's F-35
program manager said on Friday. 
Lorraine Martin, executive vice president and F-35 general
manager, said 2013 has been a transformative year for the
program, marking the beginning of pilot and maintainer training,
continued reduction in production costs, software, weapons
testing and other technical issues.
