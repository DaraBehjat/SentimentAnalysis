     After an underwhelming Black Friday, investors will be watching Cyber Monday shopping figures for further clues as to the health of the U.S. consumer. The  National Retail Federation  reported that shoppers spent an average of 4% less over the holiday weekend, the first decline in spending since 2009.

Those reports will kick off "a bumper week of U.S. data over the next five days, in part making up for two days of blackout last week for Thanksgiving," said Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid     The November jobs report is due Friday and that could give investors a better sense of how much longer the Federal Reserve will maintain its massive stimulus program at current levels.

Asian markets  ended mixed after manufacturing data out of China exceeded analyst expectations and state regulators signaled they would soon lift a  moratorium on IPOs . The Hang Seng gained 1%, while the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.5% as investors eyed the opportunity to move cash into new listings.
