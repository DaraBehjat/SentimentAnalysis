     Purchases made on  mobile devices  surged 55.4% year-over-year, and made up 17% of Monday's total online sales, according to IBM's e-commerce report.     Smartphones were more popular for making purchases than Tablets, said IBM.

But that's partly because many retailers, including Toys 'R' Us,  WalMart   ( WMT ,  Fortune 500 ) ,  Target   ( TGT ,  Fortune 500 )  and  Best Buy   ( BBY ,  Fortune 500 ) , opened their doors on Thanksgiving Thursday, cutting into the traditional Black Friday sales.     ShopperTrak said sales for Black Weekend, which spans Thanksgiving Day through Sunday, crept up 1% compared to last year.     "Black Friday shopping is no longer a one-day event," the firm said in a press release.               First Published: December 3, 2013: 9:30 AM ET
