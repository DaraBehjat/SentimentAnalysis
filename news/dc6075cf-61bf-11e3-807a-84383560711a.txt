A senior human resources executive  recently said to me, “I think we are approaching a tipping point where there will be backlash about the commercialization of the season. It saddens me that the consumer aspect has swallowed up so much of what used to be special.”   
Far be it for me to bah-humbug the spending and commercialization of the holiday season, but this woman is just one of many people who’ve told me in one way or another that the hype and spending has gotten in the way of the holiday spirit for them. And it’s hard to disagree, what with holiday shopping madness starting earlier and earlier—enough to interrupt the preceding holiday (which used to be a safe haven before the chaos ensued). We need a return to the values that so many of us associate with this time of year.  
The simple path back:  Make it a point to reconnect with the true meaning of the holiday. Connection—to meaning, to each other—is what can keep us from being subsumed by the stressfulness of this time of year. The key is shifting our attention and intention.  
Follow this 5-step guide to taking back your holiday season:  
Make it more about the gesture than the gift . It’s easy to get caught up in the who, what, how much. Let’s worry less on the gifts we give and how they reflect on us, and more on what it says about your relationship to the people you’ve worked hard alongside all year. When you focus on showing that person how they have made your world a little better this year, the gift becomes more reflective of your relationship, and less about the price tag.  
Use your words.  As we often say to our children, words matter. And during the holiday season what you say matters as much as, if not more than, what you give. Tell people how you value them, how grateful you are, and how much you’re looking forward to growing with them in the future.  
Acknowledge the team’s accomplishments . It’s the end of the year, and a time to take stock of what you’ve accomplished. This isn’t just about bonuses and gift exchanges, but about how you as a team have worked and lived together essentially over the past 12 months. Make a public show of it and recognize each person for the role they played. Most people will be most moved by hearing you say that their efforts matter to you, that you appreciate what they have done, as individuals and as a team.  
Do less and enjoy more . Dispense with over-the-top parties as a sign of appreciation, and opt for informal get-togethers and potlucks where everyone’s a contributor. Create an environment where true connection and camaraderie can occur. People don’t remember the menu; they remember the laughter and fun.  
Refresh . Use the holiday season as a countdown to getting prepared – physically and mentally for the New Year. So rather than wear yourself out, focus on what you can do as a team and individually to maximize this time of year so that you can start strong in 2014.  
Reuse and recycle.  And toward a more authentic holiday season, be conscious of the degree to which you contribute to the exploitation of resources—and minimize it best you can. Choose gifts that use less packaging, generate less waste, and create less wear and tear on ourselves and the environment.
