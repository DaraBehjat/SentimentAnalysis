   This screenshot from the “Need for Speed Rivals” video game shows the hideout that Ford branded, with a 2015 Mustang pulling up in front. 
 
Those eager to try out the 2015 Ford Mustang can take it for a virtual spin now.  
A free download allows players of the popular video game “Need for Speed Rivals” to add the newly redesigned Mustang.  
Electronic Arts and Ford released the digital version of the vehicle for the game today. The all-new Mustang doesn’t go on sale until the spring, so gamers will have a head start in getting acquainted with this highly anticipated muscle car.  
The download is available when users go online through their gaming console. “Need For Speed Rivals” itself is new, having just launched worldwide on Nov. 16 for Playstation, Xbox and PC. It is the 20th version of the “Need for Speed” video game, the most popular racing franchise of all time, which dates back to 1994. The Ford Mustang has been featured in it since inception, albeit only as a cop car at first.  
Unlike “Gran Turismo” and other hyper-realistic driving simulators, which seek to recreate a real-world experience, “Need for Speed” dispenses with reality for the most part, in favor of allowing impossible feats.  
Players are rewarded with points for doing stunts like power slides and 100-foot jumps off a cliff.  
The points let players buy and customize new rides, be it an Aston Martin Vanquish , a McLaren P1, a Pagani Huayra, or now the 2015 Ford Mustang.  
The faster the car, the better, as the cops in this game, which players must evade, have formidable wheels of their own. Those include the 2014 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, along with Bugatti Veyrons, Koenigsegg Ageras and Lamborghini Aventadors, for example.  
While driving the 2015 Ford Mustang in the game isn’t a proxy for a real test drive, “Need for Speed Rivals” does offer an exciting experience, thanks to amazing graphics that look almost cinematic and authentic driving dynamics that make cars pitch, roll and dive during high-speed maneuvers, much like they would in the real world.  
Renderings of all the cars are based on actual CAD data from the automakers (which use these same computer-aided designs as they create the real cars).  
“It’s almost an exact one-to-one of what you would see if that was the real thing sitting here next to you today,” says Kevin O’Leary, senior production manager at EA. “So those kinds of things are very authentic. You’re going to hear the audio, which is recorded from the cars as well, in a variety of scenarios.”  
EA’s producers and developers spent time behind the wheel of the vehicles featured in the video game—a grueling job, no doubt—to get a feel for them how those vehicles handle in real life.  

  
   Ford Mustangs are on both sides of the law in “Need for Speed Rivals.” Players can choose a Shelby GT500 cop car shown in this screen shot from the game. 
 
The game makers drew on this experience to recreate the driving dynamics of the actual vehicles in their virtual counterparts, O’Leary says.  
EA also brought professional rally driver Ken Block on as a consultant to help determine how vehicles should behave when, say, you hit the brakes while entering a hairpin turn at 90 miles per hour.
