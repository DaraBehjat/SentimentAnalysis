Dec 13 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said Chief
Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf, touted as a possible
candidate for the top job at Microsoft Corp, will
become the chipmaker's CEO in March, replacing Paul Jacobs who
becomes executive chairman. The surprise announcement comes a day after Bloomberg News
reported that Microsoft has been considering Mollenkopf as a
candidate to replace retiring CEO Steve Ballmer. However, Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher said he did not
think the prospect that Mollenkopf might be poached by Microsoft
was a factor in the timing of the appointment. The choice of the two-decade company veteran ensured
continuity at the top of Qualcomm, analysts said. "We believe that Mollenkopf had effectively been running the
day-to-day operations of the company, so we don't expect daily
operations to change materially, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said
in an email. Qualcomm shares were up 0.6 percent at $73.14 in early
trading on the Nasdaq. Microsoft shares were down 0.6 percent at
$36.99. While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from chips that allow
phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit
comes from licensing patents for its CDMA cellphone technology. Mollenkopf, an engineer in his mid 40s, will replace Jacobs
on March 4, after the annual shareholder meeting. Jacobs, 51, has been CEO since 2005, taking over from his
father Irwin who co-founded Qualcomm in 1985. Kelleher said Jacobs' move to the chairman's role was in
keeping with the trend among tech companies such as Broadcom
Corp and Juniper Networks Inc, where founders
or members of the founding family have moved away from the CEO
role to become strategic leaders or visionaries. Mollenkopf led Qualcomm in its $3.1 billion acquisition of
radio frequency chipmaker Atheros Communications Inc in 2011,
its biggest acquisition.
