                       Britain should push ahead with fracking, the chairman of the government s advisory body on climate change has said. 
         Lord Deben said exploiting Britain s shale gas reserves would provide a secure source of energy for decades without wrecking the environment. 
         Speaking to the Times , he dismissed environmental concerns raised by  people on the green end . 
         Greenpeace says fracking is harmful and would fail to reduce energy bills. 
   
   

     Lord Deben dismissed environmental concerns about fracking 
   
       Lord Deben - who as John Gummer was environment secretary under John Major - chairs the Committee on Climate Change, which was set up in 2008 to advise the government on emissions and analyse climate change science, economics and policy. 
         It just isn t true that fracking is going to destroy the environment and the world is going to come to an end if you frack,  he said. 
         And yet to listen to some people on the green end, that s what they say. 
   Divine difficulty 
	       The peer - a former environment secretary - said people  ought to be worried about the security of our energy supplies  and suggested it would be  much better  to have more UK-sourced gas. 
         The carbon budgets have already assumed that we are going to use gas well on through the 2020s and into the 30s,  he added. 
         But he said shale gas was unlikely to lead to reduced energy bills because  God has managed to put it in the places where it s going to be most difficult  to get planning permission to frack. 
         Fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - is a process of drilling deep underground and injecting water, chemicals and sand into rock at high pressure to release shale gas. 
         Chancellor George Osborne, giving his Autumn Statement last week, announced more financial support for companies extracting shale gas, with tax rates on early profits to be halved. 
         The environmental effects of fracking, such as the  possible impact on water supplies , are disputed.

		 How fracking recovers natural gas from shale 
		 
    
		




       Fracking is widespread in the US, but in the UK exploratory drilling at sites including Balcombe in West Sussex and Barton Moss, Greater Manchester, have been hampered by protests. 
         Campaign group Frack Off says the process could lead to  toxic and radioactive water contamination , air pollution and  devastating  effects on the countryside.  
         Greenpeace says fracking is the  last thing we need  because it would provide more fossil fuel, contributing to climate change. 
         It also says fracking would waste and possibly contaminate water supplies and harm the countryside. 
         The costs of the process in Britain and the fact gas could be  sold to the highest bidder  - possibly overseas - would prevent it bringing down UK energy bills, Greenpeace says.
