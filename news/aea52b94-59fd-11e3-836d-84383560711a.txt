TORONTO  Nov 29 (Reuters) - Pilots at WestJet Airlines Ltd
 turned down a tentative agreement with the company,
Canada's second largest airline said on Friday, but the airline
said no labor disruption was expected. 
The growing, Calgary-based low-cost carrier is not
unionized. WestJet pilots, represented by the non-union group
WestJet Pilots Association, voted against the deal by a 58.7
percent margin, with 96 percent of pilots casting a vote, the
airline said in a statement. "There is no chance of a labor disruption of any kind," said
WestJet spokesman Robert Palmer in an email. "Our pilots, like all WestJetters, have a vested interest in
the health and stability of the company, and it will be business
as usual as we head toward the busy Christmas travel season." WestJet did not disclose details of the rejected proposal
and efforts to contact the pilot's association were not
successful. WestJet's chief executive officer Gregg Saretsky said the
airline was disappointed with the results and that it would
continue to work toward a new agreement. The current deal
remains in place until a new one is reached, the airline said. WestJet, which launched a regional carrier this summer and
announced its first trans-Atlantic flight for next summer, saw
its stock finish a modest 0.2 percent higher at C$27.60 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange.
