	 Barcelona consider leaving Nou Camp 

     
         
 
								
				
				
							 

			    
                               Barcelona will make a decision in January on whether to expand their Nou Camp stadium or move to a new location.

  
               The Spanish club want to increase the capacity of Europe s largest football stadium from 99,354 to 105,000, and build a roof to cover the ground.

  
               Barcelona s board of directors will vote on the plan early in the new year.

  
               Board spokesman Toni Freixa said:  We ve made advances, we have all the information and we re in a position to make a decision. 

  
               The iconic Nou Camp has been the home of Barcelona since 1957 and has hosted two European Cup finals - in 1989 and 1999 - the World Cup in 1982 and the Olympic football tournament in 1992.

  
               Friexa said while one option would see the construction of a new stadium on ground currently belonging to the University of Barcelona, the other project involved a  profound remodelling  of the existing stadium.

  
               He added:  Both would have a capacity of 105,000 spectators, the stadium would be covered.

  
                It needs to be viable from a technical perspective, urbanist and economic. We would never submit a project that would endanger the sustainability of the club.
