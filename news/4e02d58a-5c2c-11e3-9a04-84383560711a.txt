When your uncle loans you $10,000 to tide you over, is it taxable income? Nope. What about when the bank loans you $100,000? No again. That’s provided it’s a real loan and not income. That’s a key distinction that lands lots of taxpayers in trouble.  
But if it’s a real loan and is  forgiven , it is income  then . That’s  cancellation of debt income , often shortened to  COD income . You got cash when you borrowed the money. Then when you don’t have to repay it, that cash is no longer loan proceeds.  
The tax code generally taxes you when you are relieved of paying back a debt, treating it like cash paid to you. See  10 Things About COD Income . This unpleasant rule might seem easy to ignore, except that when a loan is forgiven, you’ll generally receive a  Form 1099-C  reporting income to you—and telling the IRS. If you receive one and disagree with the amount shown, write the lender requesting a corrected  Form 1099-C  showing the proper amount of cancelled debt.  
Don’t ignore  Forms 1099 . In some cases COD income isn’t taxed. If you believe the cancelled debt isn’t income because you’re insolvent or for any other reason, you’ll need to address this on your return.  
If you receive a loan, can the IRS claim the “loan” you received—that is still outstanding and hasn’t been forgiven—isn’t a loan and was  actually a sale ? In other words, can the IRS claim that “loan” proceeds are really sales proceeds and therefore taxable?  
Sometimes, yes. That’s exactly what happened to  Jonathan Landow . Landow took out a 90% loan against securities he put up as collateral. The loan was non-recourse—meaning that Landow could not be sued personally if he defaulted. Yet the securities were pledged as collateral.  
In fact, the lender had the ability to sell the securities in ways that were unusual for garden-variety loans. And that’s just what the lender did, even though Landow later claimed he had no idea his securities would be sold. Landow didn’t pay off  any  of the $13.5 million principal amount of the loan.   
He also didn’t report the “loan proceeds” as income. The IRS claimed the loan transaction wasn’t a loan at all and instead was a sale. The Tax Court agreed with the IRS, treating the putative loan as a highly orchestrated transaction. They court thought everyone  knew  the transaction would be documented as a loan but  really  amounted to a sale.  
How real is the danger that will IRS will treat loans as sales? In transactions like Landow’s, very. Landow’s deal was part of a litigated and controversial tax shelter that produced a series of cases. See  Shao v. Commissioner  and  Kurata v. Commissioner . In that sense, the result in Landow’s case was no surprise.  
How you structure a transaction is important, as is how the transaction actually plays out. In general, courts look to indicators such as whether legal title passes, how the parties treat the transaction, and the parties’ intent. There can also be danger in simple family transactions.  
But there, the question is often whether something is a loan or a gift. Gifts may not trigger income tax, but they can trigger gift tax. Loan vs. income vs. gift? Think about taxes up front, and document what you intend. Everyone will be better off.
