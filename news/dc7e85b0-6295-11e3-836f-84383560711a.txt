     The gaming system has been sold out at many major retailers for the past two weeks. Microsoft said the average of 111,111 units Xbox units sold each day set a record for the company. At one point, customers were ordering more than 1,000 Xbox One consoles each minute on  Amazon.com   ( AMZN ,  Fortune 500 ) , according to John Love, Amazon's director of video games.     Microsoft said it will be expanding its Xbox One inventory to meet the consumer demand ahead of Christmas.      Related story: Xbox One vs. PS4, which is best?      Meanwhile,  Sony   ( SNE ) , Microsoft's biggest video game competitor, announced last week that it too has sold more than  two million PlayStation 4 systems  since its Nov. 15 launch. Sony said it  sold one million  PlayStation 4 consoles in the first 24 hours they were on sale.     Though the rivals are essentially neck and neck after two and a half weeks of sales, the  PS4  went on sale in fewer markets at launch. Sony only sold the PS4 in the United States and Canada until Nov. 29, when it expanded to Australia, New Zealand and most European countries. The Xbox launched in 13 markets including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, United States and New Zealand.
