   Manchester United star Wayne Rooney 
 
Manchester United coach David Moyes let out a sigh of relief after midfielder Phil Jones drilled one past Shakhtar Donetsk goalkeeper Pyatov earlier this week at Old Trafford stadium.  That victory allowed his team to take the first spot in their Champions League group, giving them a coveted ticket to the knockout stage and helping Moyes mask the fact that has team hasn’t delivered a victory in the Premier League in four matches and currently stands in ninth place.  Despite the win, shares in the world’s second most valuable soccer team were having a horrible week, down nearly 8% despite having posted record revenues in mid-November on reports hedge funds were shorting the stock.  
Two things could be weighing heavily on the stock, which counts with the backing of billionaire  George Soros ,  BlackRock   BlackRock ,  and GLG, a division of the world’s biggest hedge fund  Man Group   Man Group , and was once in  Steve Cohen ’s portfolio: Moyes’ capacity to deliver on pitch success, which directly feeds the top line, and the possibility that billionaire owner Malcolm Glazer could flood the market with $400 million in new shares, and even possibly sell a big chunk of his massive personal position, worth over $2.4 billion.  That may be what London hedgie Crispin Odey is basing his short thesis on.  
Odey Asset Management initiated a 310,000-share short position in early December, worth about $5 million dollars.  The intriguing hedge fund manager joined Tremblant Capital, which has held a 321.5 million share short position since April, records show.  Neither Odey nor Tremblant agreed to comment on this story.  
On the face of it, shorting Manchester United seems like a bad idea.  The soccer club is a global powerhouse, having seen its revenues jump 29% to a record $158 million in the first quarter, while operating income rose 36% to $35.6 million.  As my colleague Mike Ozanian  reported , underlying the club’s success has been its commercial strength, which has catapulted the segment.  Now making up more than 60% of sales, commercial revenues have surged on the back of lucrative sponsorship deals, with 12 new ones signed in Q1 including Aeroflot, Bulova, and Pepsi.  Manchester United’s deal kit deal with Nike continues to deliver, while the club is set to begin milking their massive $559 million jersey sponsorship deal with General Motors’ Chevrolet brand.  While the Red Devils lost their spot as number one most valuable soccer team in Forbes’  list of valuations to Real Madrid this year, the team is valued at an impressive $3.165 billion.  
Beyond the compelling story from a marketing and financial position, even Moyes’ struggles as a manager, replacing the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson after an  unprecedented 27 years on the job , shouldn’t have a meaningful impact on earnings growth in the short term.  After taking the Premier League for a record 20th time last year, United has been its own worst enemy on the pitch domestically this season and doesn’t seem to be a serious contender for the title.  
The Red Devils also play the prestigious UEFA Champions League, where Moyes has done substantially better, clinching the first place in his group, thus making it to the knockout stage and securing additional TV money.  In their latest  earnings , the team’s management expects at least a quarter final run in the Champions League, and to close off the season in third place domestically.  Broadcasting revenues, which made up 19.5% of total sales in the first quarter, will probably take a small hit if they don’t bring home any silverware.  With Robin Van Persie injured and the potential to face AC Milan in the round of 16, it could get complicated for Moyes’ boys.  
The real downside potential for the stock has a lot more to do with Wall Street than with what’s going on in Manchester.  In a  filing  with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated October 24, the Glazers said they are looking to sell up to $400 million in new shares through a stock placement; the shelf placement document also revealed “selling shareholders” could dump up to 23.02 million shares (which they valued at about $392 million).  That’s exactly how much Red Football, the Glazer’s holding entity, owns of the team’s Class A ordinary shares; the Glazers are also sitting on 124 million B shares which have ten times the voting power.  
Manchester United is a low float stock, with only 10% of shares outstanding being traded.  The Glazer family owns 57.8% of the stock, but controls 98.7% of the voting power, giving them a solid grasp on management decisions.  While the Glazers weren’t immediately available for comment, it appears unlikely for them to sell all of their shares and exit their investment in Manchester United, as they’re involved in the team’s operations and seem like proud owners.  That doesn’t mean they couldn’t take some profits off the table after a decent performance since the August 2012 IPO; the stock is up about 20% since then, trailing the broader market.  
Crispin Odey is a savvy investor in charge of a hedge fund that manages more than $11 billion.  Odey, who made headlines in the UK for a brief marriage to Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Prudence, and for planning to build a lavish, Parthenon-like house for his chickens, is betting Manchester United’s shares will fall.  Whether it’s a bet on Moyes’ failure as a manager, on the financial situation of the company, or on the difficulty to keep on fuieling earnings growth through partnership deals, remains unclear.  What is certain, though, is that if Moyes manages to take his team far in the Champions League, or if his team picks up in the Premiership in the second half of the season, Odey may be forced to book some losses.
