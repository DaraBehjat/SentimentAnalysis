Dec 12 (Reuters) - Empire Co Ltd, owner of
Canada's No. 2 grocer, reported an 84 percent jump in
second-quarter earnings as cost controls helped to offset weaker
margins. 
Sales at the company's Sobeys grocery chain rose 2 percent
to C$4.42 billion ($4.17 billion) in the three months to Nov. 2. Total sales also increased by about 2 percent, to C$4.43
billion. Sobeys, like other Canadian retailers, is facing increasing
competition from Wal-Mart and Target, which are
expanding their presence in Canada. Empire's net earnings rose to C$169.2 million, or C$2.48 per
share, from C$91.9 million, or C$1.35 per share, a year earlier.
