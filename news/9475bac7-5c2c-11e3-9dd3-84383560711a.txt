* Grace period, maturity of loan extended until end 2014,
2016 
* Has net debt of $9.6 billion MOSCOW  Dec 3 (Reuters) - Debt-laden Russian miner Mechel
  said on Tuesday it had reached a deal to
extend the grace period and maturity of a $1 billion syndicated
loan, bringing some relief to talks with its creditors that have
unsettled investors. Under the new terms the grace period and maturity were
extended until the end of 2014 and 2016 respectively, Mechel
said in a statement. The coal-to-steel group, with debts of $9.6 billion, has
been undergoing extensive debt restructuring negotiations and
signs of a hitch in talks caused the firm's share price to
plunge over 40 percent on Nov. 13. "This will enable us to successfully pass the commodity
price depression. Additionally, it will greatly ease the
pressure on Mechel's cashflow in the next 12 months," Chief
Financial Officer Stanislav Ploschenko said. Mechel was granted a waiver on the terms of another $1
billion loan on Nov. 25. The latest deal allows Mechel to move around $600 million of
repayments from 2013-2014 to 2015-2016, Ploschenko said. ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Caterpillar Financial Services
Corporation, Commerzbank, ICBC (London), ING, Natixis,
Raiffeisen, Societe Generale, UniCredit and Russian state bank
VTB were the banks that provided the syndicated loan. Loans from Russian banks - mainly VTB, Gazprombank and
Sberbank - account for around 60 percent of Mechel's debt, and
foreign banks another 22 percent, according to the company. Talks with Russian banks on covenant holidays on loans are
ongoing, a Mechel spokesman said. Mechel's New York-listed shares had yet to start trading.
Its Moscow-listed stock were trading up 3.6 percent at 1339 GMT,
rising from near the bottom of the index on news of the
agreement.
