Dec 2 (Reuters) - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp
 will hire at least 10,000 people in the United States
over the next three years, the IT services firm's president,
Gordon Coburn, said. 
The company currently employs more than 29,000 in the United
States. It had about 166,400 employees as of September, with the
majority of its employees being located in India. Shares of IT services companies took a hit earlier this year
on news that the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee was debating a
draft immigration bill that could hurt Indian outsourcing firms'
businesses in the United States. () Cognizant is one of the top applicants for green cards in
India and analysts have estimated that about 65 percent of
Cognizant's employees in the United States work on H-1B or L-1
visas, or work permits. Coburn also said the company will also establish the
headquarters of its U.S. operations in College Station, Texas to
step up recruitment of science, technology, engineering and math
(STEM) graduates. The company's global headquarters will remain in Teaneck,
New Jersey. "750 or more (hires) will be in Texas," Coburn said.
Cognizant also announced a $150,000 grant to the Texas A 
University to promote STEM education. The company, one of the largest STEM recruiters in the
United States, hired more than 7,000 there over the last two
years, Coburn said. "We have not set specific (hiring) goals for India or other
regions," he said. However, he added hiring will continue in
other regions.
