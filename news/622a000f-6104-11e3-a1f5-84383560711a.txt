ZURICH  Dec 9 (Reuters) - Valiant Holding AG said
it would come forward to work with U.S. officials in a crackdown
on wealthy Americans evading taxes through hidden offshore
accounts. 
The Swiss regional bank, the first to say it will
participate in a government-brokered scheme to make amends for
aiding tax evasion, said it could not say definitively that all
its U.S. clients paid their taxes. "The costs of the US program will not jeopardize the
financial stability of Valiant in any way. This decision does
not endanger the distribution of an unchanged dividend," Valiant
said in a statement on Monday. Switzerland's banks had until Monday to decide whether to
bow to U.S. pressure and ditch the centuries-old culture of
secrecy that has made the Alpine state a global vault for the
world's rich.
