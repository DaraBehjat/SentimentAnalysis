MADRID  Nov 28 (Reuters) - Spain's Santander said
on Thursday its Mexican unit would pay a dividend
of between $1 billion to $1.3 billion and issue subordinated
debt worth around $1 billion. 
The operation would optimise the capital structure of the
unit, the bank said, adding it would subscribe 75 percent of the
debt issued. The Mexican unit would have a Tier 1 capital ratio, a
measure of solvency, of at least 12 percent after the operation,
it also said.
