Yesterday, the owners of Chicagoâ€™s NBA and NHL teams  announced  a new naming rights deal for the United Center, the arena the Bulls and Blackhawks share.  
United Airlines agreed to pay $36 million over 20 years for the naming rights when the arena opened in 1994 (United Airlines and  Continental   Continental  Airlines  merged  in 2010 and   became one airline  early last year). The new deal with UAL will be worth around an average of $5 million a year, and the airline will continue to serve as the official airline of the United Center, the Bulls, and the Blackhawks, and will receive advertising and promotional exclusivity in the Airline category and logo usage rights for all three entities.  
The new deal will line the pockets of Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz, but will not show up on the P L statements of the two teams. Instead, the money will flow to United Airlines Joint Venture, the hugely profitable entity that is owned 50-50 by Reinsdorf and Wirtz.  
Financial figures  published  in 2013 by Sean Dinces, a PhD candidate for  Brown University , show that from 2004 through 2007  operating income for United Center JV, which also includes revenue from luxury suites, advertising and other amenities, was $80 million.  
Which is why when Wirtz  says  his Stanley Cup winning team is losing money you should understand why the value of his team, now worth  $625 million , continues to escalate.
