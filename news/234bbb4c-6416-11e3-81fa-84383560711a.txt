     Stocks have surged this year, but the rally has faltered in December. The major gauges, which are up between 20% and 32% so far this year, are on track to end lower for the week.     The recent retreat comes amid speculation that the Fed could begin cutting back, or tapering, its $85-billion-per-month bond-buying program when it wraps up its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 18.     But some strategists say the economy is still too weak for the Fed to start removing its support, despite the recent improvement in hiring.     "In this environment, the last thing the Fed wants to do is make a hasty decision it will later regret," said Scott Wren, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.

Producer prices fell 0.1% in November, according to the Commerce Department. The Fed's target for consumer price inflation is 2%, and some economists say the central bank is more concerned about deflation than the size of its balance sheet.     The tepid inflation data suggests the Fed might wait to see if the recent  pick up in economic activity  has legs "rather than risk tapering prematurely again," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities.     Meanwhile,  the bond market  is on track to have its worst year in history. Investors have pulled out $72 billion from bond mutual funds this year through the first week of December, the biggest annual outflow on record.     The yield on the  10-year note  rose to 2.89% this week, near the highest levels of the year, as investors brace for next week's Fed meeting. Bond yields rise when prices fall, so investors seem to be selling now in anticipation of fewer Fed purchases in the future.

Qualcomm   ( QCOM ,  Fortune 500 )  named chief operating officer Steve Mollenkopf as its next CEO, succeeding Dr. Paul Jacobs, who will remain as executive chairman. Mollenkopf's name was recently tossed around as a  possible successor to Steve Ballmer  at  Microsoft   ( MSFT ,  Fortune 500 ) .      Electronic Arts   ( EA )  and  GameStop    ( GME ,  Fortune 500 ) shares rallied after industry research group NDP said video game hardware sales jumped in November.      Twitter   ( TWTR )  shares were up about 3%, extending a run this week that has pushed the stock up nearly 30%.     Shares of petroleum company  Anadarko   ( APC ,  Fortune 500 )  were down sharply after a court ruled that it and its Kerr-McGee unit acted improperly in its 2005 spinoff of paint materials company  Tronox   ( TROX ) . The judge said that the company should pay for environmental cleanup.      European markets  drifted lower in afternoon trading.  Asian markets  ended mixed.
