* Seismic survey is first conducted in zone by industry 
* First offshore zone open to exploration since 1994 * Norway's Polarcus to participate - CEO By Henrik Stolen OSLO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Seventeen oil companies, including
most of the majors, are teaming up to map the seabed in an
Arctic offshore zone once disputed by Russia and Norway, showing
their eagerness to explore for oil in the remote region. Despite recent setbacks such as the grounding of Royal Dutch
Shell's drillship off Alaska, energy firms remain keen
to explore for crude in the area, which the U.S. Geological
Survey estimates to hold 90 billion barrels of oil. The new area on the Norwegian side, which is as large as
Switzerland, is being opened to energy firms following a border
deal between Oslo and Moscow in 2010. It is the first area to be
opened off Norway in nearly two decades. The Norwegian Oil Directorate had already mapped some of the
area. But on Tuesday, the Norwegian oil industry lobby said 17
oil firms would cooperate in commissioning more surveys of the
seabed. They are: BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips
, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, Lukoil,
Idemitsu, Repsol, Det norske,
Wintershall, Suncor, VNG, PGNiG
, Spike, Statoil, GDF Suez and
Lundin Petroleum. Tendering will begin immediately, with surveying starting in
April next year and concluding in the autumn, Statoil said in a
separate statement. Norwegian seismic surveyor Polarcus said it would
participate in the tender, which might be big enough to secure
work for two or three seismic vessels that search for oil and
gas deposits under the sea. "This means there will be a lot of work coming up in the
eastern part of the Barents Sea," Chief Executive Rolf
Roenningen told Reuters.
