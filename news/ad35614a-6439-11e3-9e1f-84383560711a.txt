WASHINGTON  Dec 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on
Friday agreed to decide what federal prosecutors need to prove
in order for someone to be convicted of bank fraud under federal
law. 
The court agreed to hear the case of Kevin Loughrin, who was
convicted in Salt Lake City, Utah, of six counts of bank fraud
for stealing checks that he then altered so he could purchase
merchandise at Target Corp stores. Loughrin's lawyers say federal prosecutors should have to
prove that their client intended to defraud the banks under
which the checks were issued. Federal appeals courts are split
on the intent-to-defraud question. Loughrin told police that his aim was to purchase products
using the checks and then return the items for cash refunds. He
was charged with using altered checks totaling $1,184. At trial, he argued that although Target suffered a loss,
the banks under which the checks were issued did not because
Target never submitted them for payment. Loughrin was sentenced
to three years in prison. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction
in a March 13 ruling. Loughrin is not appealing his related convictions for
identity theft and possession of stolen mail. Loughrin carried out the scheme with an accomplice, Theresa
Thongsarn, who is not part of the appeal. She pleaded guilty,
according to one of Loughrin's lawyers. A Supreme Court decision is expected by the end of June. The case is Loughrin v. United States, U.S. Supreme Court,
13-316.
