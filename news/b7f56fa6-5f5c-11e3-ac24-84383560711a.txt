The pain in  Spain’s electric power industry  went from bad to worse this week as the Spanish government reneged on promises to plug the growing gap between the cost of running the electric system and the revenue generated by selling power to consumers.  
On Monday, the Spanish government withdrew $4.9 billion in public funds previously earmarked to fix the so-called “tariff deficit,” which refers to the shortfall between revenues and system costs (including the cost of subsidies for renewable energy and non-mainland power generation).  
Once again, the sustainability of the Spanish electricity system is surrounded by question marks.  
The tariff deficit has become a major problem for Spain’s “ Big Five ” energy utilities, which includes Iberdrola, Endesa,  Gas Natural Fenosa , Hidrocantabrico and E.ON Spain.  
The Spanish government’s withdrawal of previously announced funding means the electricity sector will generate a new tariff deficit (TD) in 2013 of $4 and $7 billion, which will have to be carried on utilities’ balance sheets, according to  Fitch Ratings .  
The funds have been reallocated to the reduction of the public deficit. The decision reflects the government’s new focus on reducing its budget deficit and improving public finances.  
Depending on the impact of subsidy reforms for renewable energy, the tariff deficit is projected to grow by an estimated $5 billion in 2013 without the government support measures, which will push the cumulative deficit to more than $60 billion.
