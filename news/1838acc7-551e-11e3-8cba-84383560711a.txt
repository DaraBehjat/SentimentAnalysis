          Holiday Money                comments       Correction and update: Wal-Mart Thanksgiving pay story   By Emily Jane Fox   @emilyjanefox     November 22, 2013: 3:19 PM ET           NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story featured Wal-Mart worker Barbara Gertz, who had told CNNMoney that she would be working Thanksgiving day.    Gertz now says she is not scheduled to work this Thanksgiving and that she did not work the holiday last year either.

     On Friday, Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan sent this statement: "Our records showed that Barbara was not scheduled to work on Thanksgiving, nor did she work last Thanksgiving, and, in fact, she doesn't work on Thursdays in general. She will, however, receive holiday pay, as will all associates who work their regularly scheduled shifts during Thanksgiving week, regardless of whether they work on Thursday."      Wal-Mart    ( WMT ,  Fortune 500 ) didn't respond specifically to Gertz's claims about reduced hours during the holidays when first contacted by CNNMoney on Wednesday.     CNNMoney pursued this story because of reports from other workers that Wal-Mart pays holiday pay differently from other retailers.     The company gives employees a regular hourly wage plus additional pay for working the Thanksgiving holiday. Wal-Mart had said on a Nov. 11 conference call with the news media that the additional pay is equal to the average daily wage in the two weeks leading up to the holiday.     But on Friday, Wal-Mart said it had made a mistake on that call and in subsequent conversations with CNNMoney. It said the additional pay is actually equal to the average daily wage in the 12 weeks leading up to the holiday.     Workers have told CNNMoney over the past year that their hours have been cut leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, which ends up reducing their holiday pay.     Wal-Mart said it is not cutting its workers' hours leading up to Black Friday since this is the busiest time of year.     Many of Wal-Mart's rivals --  Target,   ( TGT ,  Fortune 500 )   Sears,    ( SHLD ,  Fortune 500 ) Kmart,  J.C. Penney   ( JCP ,  Fortune 500 )  and Toys R Us -- pay time-and-a-half to workers who work Thanksgiving.     Wages have been a common theme in high-profile protests carried out by Wal-Mart workers over the past year. A federal government agency is preparing a possible case against Wal-Mart for allegedly retaliating against workers who staged Black Friday protests last year.
