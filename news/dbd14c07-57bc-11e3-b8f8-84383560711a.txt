NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   Black Friday has morphed into Black Thursday, and a lot of shoppers aren't happy. They're lashing out at major retailers online, threatening to boycott stores that are opening early on Thanksgiving.    Among their biggest targets:  Kmart  plans to kick Thanksgiving day off, opening stores at 6 a.m. and remaining open for 41 hours straight.

      Toys "R" Us  starts its doorbusters at 5 p.m. At  Wal-Mart stores  (many of which are open all day), the deals start at 6 p.m.     Best Buy opens at 6 p.m., and then Macy's, Kohl's, J.C. Penney, Target and Sears all open at 8 p.m.     An " I pledge to not shop on Thanksgiving " badge is circulating on Facebook and has been shared more than 959,000 times as of mid-day Wednesday.      Related: Are you working during the holidays? Share your story      "5 pm open on Thanksgiving? Really?" wrote  Jaime Etheridge Krauss  on the Toys "R" Us Facebook page. "A store who is devoted to children and families opens when Americans sit down at the dinner table? What about your employees?!?"     "Hey Kmart! Because of you being Open on Thanksgiving and totally disrespecting your employees, Our Family will never spend a $ in your store!" writes  Frank Chip Munroe .     "Kohl's has always been my absolute favorite place to shop. However, as much as it breaks my heart to say this I will no longer be shopping at Kohl's from this point on or any of the other retailers that are opening ON THANKSGIVING. This is a day for family and giving thanks," wrote  Kelli Williams Lord .     "Macy's I am disappointed in you for opening your stores on Thanksgiving. Let your employees have a day with their families! It is not the end of the world to wait until Friday to start the chaos!" wrote  Katie Buchanan Reynolds .     "I always wanted to believe that Target was somehow better than Walmart in product, and in policies. I realize that Target does not share my values and will no longer get my business. Give your employees a paid day off!" wrote  Sean Pierce .     "Even Ebenezer Scrooge let Bob Cratchit go home a few minutes early on Christmas Eve," wrote  Dan Hall  on J.C. Penney's page. "When you're eating your Thanksgiving turkey this year, remember that your employees are taking time away from their families to help satisfy your greed."      Poll: Do you think Black Friday is worth it?       Of course, the real test of shopper anger will come tomorrow night: Will the the outraged shoppers be outnumbered by people who turn out for the deals?     The holiday shopping season was cut six days shorter this year because Thanksgiving falls later on the calendar, and retailers are fearing sales could be flat.
