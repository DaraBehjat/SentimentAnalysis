WASHINGTON (CNNMoney)   President Obama's newest priority is pushing Congress to extend federal unemployment benefits by another year, and Republicans say they're willing to consider the idea.    Benefits for 1.3 million workers  will expire Dec. 28 if Congress fails to extend a recession-era program  by the end of this month.

     The White House Council of Economic Advisers and Department of Labor issued a joint report touting how jobless benefits  buoy the economy,  while keeping 2.5 million workers out of poverty each year.     Allowing unemployment benefits to expire "would be harmful to millions of workers and their families," according to the report.     President Obama started using his bully pulpit this week to put more pressure on Congress to extend the program.

"(That's) what will happen if Congress does not act before they leave on their holiday vacation."     The White House points out that if benefits expire,  U.S. GDP could fall next year  by 0.2 to 0.4 of a percentage point, according to the Congressional Budget Office and a  J.P. Morgan Chase   ( JPM ,  Fortune 500 )  economist.     The report also suggests the economy isn't strong enough to end benefits.     Republicans had been cool to the idea of extending benefits, saying in memos that the program has already cost $252 billion through July.     But, on Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner suggested he was open to an extension.     "If the President has a plan for extending unemployment, I'll take a look at it," Boehner said.     The program was first signed into law in June 2008 by President George W. Bush, when the unemployment rate was 5.6% and the average duration of jobless insurance was 17.1 weeks.     The  unemployment rate climbed  to more than 10% at the height of the Great Recession in 2009, and the government extended the federal benefits to jobless Americans whose state unemployment insurance had run out.     However, thanks to a weak recovery, those benefits have been either extended or expanded 11 times,  most recently on Jan. 2  . Today, the  unemployment rate is at 7.3% , and the average duration of the benefits is 36.1 weeks.

Only residents in Nevada and Illinois have access to the maximum 47 weeks, according to the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group. Most states have cut back unemployment benefits, as the  labor market has improved.      "As lawmakers prepare to head home to be with their families during the holiday recess, they must not turn their backs on millions of families struggling with long-term unemployment and a weak labor market," said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project in a statement.     vidConfig.push({ videoArray : [ {id : "/video/news/2013/11/08/n-labor-secretary-thomas-perez-low-wage-jobs-minimum-wage.cnnmoney", hed: "Labor Sec. responds to low-wage job growth"} ], playerprofile : 'story', playerid : 'cvp_0', divid : 'vid0', hedtarget : '#cnnplayer0 .cnnHeadline' });                    Labor Sec. responds to low-wage job growth          The cost to extend the  federal benefits  by another year is about $26 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.      -- CNN's Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.
