* Brazil Bovespa gains 0.13 pct, Mexico IPC falls 0.94 pct

    SAO PAULO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks posted slight
gains on Friday, led by shares of state-controlled firms, though
advances were limited by lingering investor caution over the
potential tapering of economic stimulus from the U.S. Federal
Reserve.
    Mexico's IPC index reopened lower after a market
holiday on Thursday, while Chile's bourse slipped for
the third straight session.
    The Fed's bond-buying program has helped support global
demand for riskier assets such as Latin American equities, but
it is expected to be reduced in scale as the U.S. economic
recovery gains steam.
     Investors have avoided taking big positions in local shares
until after the Fed makes a decision on the program at its next
policy-setting meeting, scheduled to take place on Dec. 17 and
18.
    Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.13
percent to 50,186.12, but is on track to close the session with
a 1.4 percent weekly loss.
    "It was a tough week and the trend is still one of caution,"
said Pedro Galdi, a broker with SLW Corretora in Sao Paulo. "If
(the Fed) cuts stimulus by 10 billion dollars, it's already
priced in. Above that, the market could react. If they wait
until March, it will rise."
    Shares of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA
, known as Petrobras, rose 0.95 percent, contributing
most to the index's rise. 
    State-controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA added
1.4 percent, while private-sector rival Banco Bradesco SA
 advanced 1.1 percent.
    Shares of mining firm Vale SA anchored the index,
losing 0.85 percent.
    Mexico's IPC index fell for the second straight
session, losing 0.94 percent to 41,907.71.
    Shares of bottling firm Femsa lost 2.22
percent, contributing most to the index's decline, while    
telecommunications firm America Movil, controlled by
billionaire Carlos Slim, fell 1 percent.
    Chile's IPSA index fell 0.31 percent as shares of
conglomerate Copec slipped 1.4 percent.
