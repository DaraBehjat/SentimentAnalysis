FRANKFURT  Dec 11 (Reuters) - German drugs wholesaler
Celesio said its supervisory and management board
recommended shareholders accept the $8.3 billion takeover offer
from McKesson Corp. and viewed the price as fair, a day
after a shareholder called for a higher offer. 
Hedge fund Elliott international, which has built up a stake
of over 20 percent in recent weeks, had on Tuesday pressed for a
higher offer than the 23 euros ($31.72) per share being offered
by the U.S. company. Celesio said in a statement on Wednesday that after having
considered various options, its boards viewed a takeover by
McKesson as the right strategic decision. "A merger with McKesson is the most attractive option for
Celesio," the company said.
