     Since January, the Dow has climbed by 22%, the  S P 500  is up by 26% and the  Nasdaq  has soared by 31%.     The Dow and the S P have continued to hit record highs, as investors and traders take comfort in the massive  stimulus program  administered by the  U.S. Federal Reserve , which has supported the economic recovery.

He questioned how effective the stimulus has been and said it poses a "growing risk to financial stability," noting that many investors are increasingly worried that stocks are in  bubble territory .
