Hong Kong late yesterday confirmed its second case of deadly H7N9 bird flu.   
A mainlander aged 80 who lives in the boarding city of Shenzhen tested positive for H7N9 in a Hong Kong hospital on Friday while seeking treatment for a chronic illness, the government said late yesterday.   
Some 140 people died in a H7N9 outbreak in the mainland earlier this year that wreaked havoc and caused billions of dollars of losses in the country’s poultry industry. The damage extended into the share price of Yum!, whose fried chicken chain KFC has relied on China for much of its growth in recent years.  Yum!’s stock declined this week amid mixed reports about the company’s business in China.   
Hong Kong on Tuesday reported its first H7N9 case, an Indonesian helper who tested positive after visiting a live poultry market in Shenzhen.
