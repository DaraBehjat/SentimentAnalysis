                We re feeling sad for the families. Sao Paulo will be ready for the opening match,  president Sepp Blatter said. 

  
                We deplore the loss of the two people who lost their lives. 

  
               Blatter added that the issues with the stadiums are  so small we can close our eyes .

  
               The 43,000-seater Arena Pantanal, where a plan for a retractable roof has been abandoned, and the 41,000 Arena da Baixada are also behind schedule.

  
               But Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke says they will all be ready by February. 

  
               Valcke said:  We don t know when the green light [to resume work] will be given [in Sao Paolo].

  
                We are not in a crisis mood, looking at an alternative to Sao Paulo but Curitiba is facing the most problems and clearly won t be delivered before February 2014.

  
                The people from Curitiba attended a meeting [on Monday] and promised to organise themselves to get the stadium ready by the end of February 2014. 

  
               The draw for next year s tournament, which starts on 12 June in Sao Paulo, takes place on Friday.
