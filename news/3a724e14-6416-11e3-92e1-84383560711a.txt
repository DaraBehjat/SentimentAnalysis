VIENNA  Dec 13 (Reuters) - EVA Air would be interested in
placing an order for Boeing's new 777X jetliner, the
president of the Taiwanese airline said on Friday. 
"It won't be available until 2020, so give us some time and
we would maybe look at it for 2023," Austin Cheng told Reuters
on the sidelines of a meeting of Star Alliance members in
Vienna. Boeing's new version of the 777 is aimed at heading off
competition from the largest version of Airbus's A350
in the mini-jumbo market that drives growth and connectivity
between continents.
