Now you see the earnings, now you don’t.

The next round of bids for Forstmann Little’s IMG Worldwide are  due  today. The groups remaining in the auction include Carlyle Group LP, Silver Lake  Management  LLC with William Morris Endeavor, and CVC Capital Partners.  
Forstmann Little is hoping to fetch some $2.5 billion for the talent representation, college sports and event production company, which are expected to generate between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in revenue and between $180 million and $200 million of operating income (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) this year.  
But some of those earnings may disappear. When the  Pac 12  conference wanted to start its own regional sports network two years ago it had to  buy back  the rights from IMG and Learfield Communications, who had over the years bought the multimedia rights to the conference’s schools. The Pac 12 had to of course pay a premium to get those rights back, which gave the earnings of IMG and Learfield a one-time boost.  
Most of the buy-back money went to IMG, who had the rights of six (UCLA, California, Oregon, Arizona State, Arizona and  University of Washington ) of the conference’s 10 original schools.  
Learfield, much smaller than IMG, was  purchased  by Provident Equity Partners in September for  reportedly  less than $1 billion. Today we should get a better idea of how much IMG will fetch.
