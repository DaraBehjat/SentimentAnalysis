      Sony   ( SNE )  said it had sold 700,000 units in Europe, Australasia and Latin America since Nov. 29. That followed sales of over  one million  during the first 24 hours in North America, which Sony says was a record for a PlayStation launch.     "Demand remains incredibly strong and continues to overwhelm the supply worldwide," said Andrew House, president and group CEO, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.     The game system is Sony's first in seven years and includes new social features, streaming video apps and a touch pad on the controller. It is compatible with about 20 games, but the catalog is expected to expand by the end of the year.
