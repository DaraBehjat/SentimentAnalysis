ROME  Dec 10 (Reuters) - Italy's insurance regulator said on
Tuesday that it was perplexed by S 's putting the country's
biggest insurer, Assicurazioni Generali, on negative
creditwatch last month. 
S 's move "is perplexing" because the insurer's Italian
assets and liabilities are well balanced, Salvatore Rossi,
president of regulator Ivass, said during a testimony in the
Senate. Standard  &  Poor's placed the insurer on credit watch
negative, pending an examination of its sovereign exposure, the
ratings agency said last month. Generali said it was surprised by Standard  &  Poor's decision,
which it said followed the adoption of a new methodology by the
ratings agency focusing on the relationship between the rating
of the company and the country in which it is primarily based.
