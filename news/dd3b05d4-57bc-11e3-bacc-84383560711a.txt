                      comments       SEC expands probe into overseas hiring by U.S. banks   By Chris Isidore   @CNNMoney     November 27, 2013: 10:26 AM ET           NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   The SEC is broadening a probe into the overseas hiring practices of U.S. banks, according to a person familiar with the matter.    At issue: Did the banks give jobs to friends and family of government officials, and in doing so, violate laws prohibiting bribery of foreign officials?

     JPMorgan Chase has already disclosed that it is the  subject of an investigation  by the SEC and U.S. Justice Department related to its hiring in Hong Kong and the Asia-Pacific region.     The person familiar with the expanded probe said the SEC has sent out letters to multiple institutions asking for information about their hiring practices. The person said the Justice Department has yet to contact other banks.

Neither bank would comment, nor would the SEC.     The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bars U.S. companies from using bribes to conduct businesses overseas.     Numerous companies have  disclosed investigations  into allegations of such practices, including  Wal-Mart Stores   ( WMT ,  Fortune 500 )  and French food maker  Danone   ( DANOY ) .     Last year drugmakers  Eli Lilly   ( LLY ,  Fortune 500 )  and  Pfizer   ( PFE ,  Fortune 500 )  each  agreed to pay the SEC  tens of millions of dollars because of  bribes  paid in overseas markets.
