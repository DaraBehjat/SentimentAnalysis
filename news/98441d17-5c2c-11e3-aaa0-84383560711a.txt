By Sam Forgione NEW YORK  Dec 3 (Reuters) - Bill Gross, co-founder and
co-chief investment officer of bond giant Pimco, said Tuesday
that easy-money policies worldwide have put global economies
increasingly at risk. Gross, writing in his monthly letter to investors, said
easy-money policies from central banks such as the U.S. Federal
Reserve and the Bank of Japan have resulted in artificially
priced assets. "Global economies and their artificially priced markets are
increasingly at risk," Gross said, and added that investors "are
all playing the same dangerous game that depends on a near
perpetual policy of cheap financing and artificially low
interest rates in a desperate gamble to promote growth." He said that stocks, investment-grade and high-yield bonds,
alternative assets, hedge funds, and unconstrained products all
reflected artificially priced markets. Gross, whose $248 billion Pimco Total Return Fund is the
world's largest bond fund, said investors should anticipate
stable policy rates until at least 2016 and focus on
short-duration assets. Pacific Investment Management Co, a unit of European
financial services company Allianz SE, had $1.97
trillion in assets as of Sept. 30, according to the firm's
website.
