TORONTO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index rose
on Wednesday after positive U.S. economic data and a German
political deal to form a coalition government supported the
market, offsetting a decline in shares of energy producers.
    The Toronto Stock Exchange's S /TSX composite index
 was unofficially up 12.29 points, or 0.09 percent, at
13,362.06. Seven of the 10 main sectors on the index were
higher.
