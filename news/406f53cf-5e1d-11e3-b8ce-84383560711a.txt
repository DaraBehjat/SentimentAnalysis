SYDNEY  Dec 6 (Reuters) - Shares in Australia's Nine
Entertainment Co Pty Ltd opened almost flat on their
debut on Friday after the company raised A$636 million ($575
million) in its initial public offering. 
Shares in the media and entertainment company opened at
A$2.02, slightly lower than its IPO price of A$2.05. The stock
last traded at A$2.02, valuing the company at A$1.9 billion. Nine's listing comes about a year after it avoided
receivership with U.S. private equity funds Oaktree Capital
Group and Apollo Global Management taking
control in a more than $3 billion debt-for-equity swap.
