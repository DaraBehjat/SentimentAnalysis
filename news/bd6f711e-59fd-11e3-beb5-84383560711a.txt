     Trading is likely to be quiet Friday, with U.S. indexes closing at 1:00 p.m. ET after being shuttered Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.     Retailers could be in focus as Black Friday gets into full swing.     The annual shopping bonanza kicked off earlier than usual, with some of the biggest stores such as  Kmart   ( SHLD ,  Fortune 500 ) ,  Wal-Mart   ( WMT ,  Fortune 500 ) ,  Best Buy   ( BBY ,  Fortune 500 ) ,  Macy's   ( M ,  Fortune 500 )  and  Target   ( TGT ,  Fortune 500 )  opening their doors on Thursday evening. Early deals were  disappearing fast .     The upbeat start tracks a strong finish for  U.S. stocks  Wednesday. Solid corporate earnings and continuing bond purchases by the Federal Reserve have helped spur strong buying this month, pushing the Dow and S P to record highs.
