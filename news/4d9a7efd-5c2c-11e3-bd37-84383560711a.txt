Most entrepreneurs simply approach venture capitalists asking for money “hat in hand”, without educating the investor on how the investor will acheive their desired 10x return on their investment, which is what most startup investors need to see from your startup in order to break through the clutter of 1,000 other startups that approach them every year. Below will help you learn how to build that bridge to a 10x return for your target investors, and hopefully, will increase your odds of being funded.  
An example Series A venture financing may look something like this:  you raise $1MM in exchange for selling 20% of your company.  That implies a $4MM pre-money valuation, and a $5MM post-money valuation of your business.  So, the new investors will need to see a financial model on how you are going to build a $50MM valuation (10x growth), over the next five years, with the use of proceeds from the monies you are raising.  
Now, let’s say you have $2MM in revenues today, implying your business was valued at 2x revenue on a $4MM pre-money valuation basis.  So, in order to build a $50MM valuation five years from now (to acheive the required 10x return), you need to show a financial growth plan that leads to $25MM in revenues by the end of that period (using that same 2x revenue multiple).  
More importantly, this revenue plan needs to be credible, with enough sales and marketing support to rationally justify that size of a business can be actually be acheived (e.g, include the costs of 25 fully-trained, fully-pipelined salespeople selling $1MM each in the fifth year, if that is a reasonable sales target with your expected average ticket and conversion rate).  And, the size of the revenue plan has to be reasonable in relation to the size of your industry (e.g., growing to 5% market share, is a lot more believable than growing to 75% market share, especially when most industry leaders rarely exceed 25% market share in their lifetime).  
In addition, if additional fund raising will be required down the road in a Series B transaction, you need to take the resulting dilution into account for the Series A investor.  So, let’s say that Series B transaction raises $5MM in exchange for selling another 20% of your business, implying a $20MM pre-money valuation and a $25MM post-money valuation in the Series B round.  So, your Series A investor got diluted down 20%, taking their original 20% stake, down to a 16% stake.  So, make sure their 16% stake in the new fully-financed model, can still keep their total returns in excess of 10x.  
If you cannot acheive a model similar to the above for your startup business, you will have a very difficult time of getting the attention of most typical venture capital firms.  So, before making those first calls to VC’s looking for money, make sure you have fully thought through this investment from THEIR perspective (not yours), to see if you can reasonably acheive their desired 10x ROI goals, and communicate such credible plan to them, to get them excited about your business.  
In addition, by creating this high-level financial model, it will give you higher credibility as an entrepreneur that understands the goals of the venture investors, thinking through their exit on the backend.  They are not going to hold you to this model, as they know many things can change for most startups between now and then.  But, at least you helped them to pass their “sniff test”, with a reasonable road to their desired returns.
