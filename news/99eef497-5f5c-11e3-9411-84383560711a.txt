NEW YORK  Dec 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Attorney's Office in
Manhattan is looking into why JPMorgan Chase  &  Co did
not file a suspicious activity report about Bernard Madoff
before he was arrested for running a multibillion-dollar Ponzi
scheme, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing
people close to the probe. 
The bank is negotiating a settlement with U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara's office over the matter that will likely include
a fine and a deferred prosecution agreement, the Journal
reported. A spokesman for the bank could not immediately be reached
for comment on the Journal story. JPMorgan had raised concerns with UK regulators about Madoff
more than a month before his arrest in December 2008, the
Journal reported. In a document filed with Britain' Serious
Organised Crime Agency, the bank raised several concerns about
Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities, such as returns that
appeared "too good to be true," the Journal said. Madoff had a banking relationship with JPMorgan for two
decades, the Journal said. In addition to the Madoff case, prosecutors and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation are examining whether there was a larger
pattern of failed controls at the bank, the paper said, citing
people close to the probe. Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence after pleading
guilty to running a Ponzi scheme that cost investors billions of
dollars. JPMorgan has said it did not know about the fraud, the
Journal said. Suspicious activity reports are required when a bank finds
suspicious transactions or signs of a violation of federal law. The Madoff probe comes as JPMorgan grapples with a string of
legal troubles. Over the past few months, it has agreed to pay
nearly $20 billion to settle lawsuits and probes, the Journal
said.
