NEW YORK  Dec 10 (Reuters) - Transactions in trades of less
than 100 shares boosted reported volume by 3 percent on the
first day that "odd lots" were included in the public
dissemination of stock quotes and sale prices, brokerage Credit
Suisse said on Tuesday. 
As expected, trades in odd lots increased volume to the
"consolidated tape" by 70 percent when compared to trading
activity over the past 30 days in stocks that trade at $300 or
higher, Credit Suisse said in a report. Before Monday, when odd lots began to print to the
consolidated tape, this data was only available on proprietary
data feeds the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq sell. The "consolidated tape" is a service all brokerage must buy
to show customers they have obtained the best prices available. Questions about odd-lot trades were raised almost four years
ago by U.S. security regulators, especially their impact on
price discovery, a key attribute of the market where buying and
selling determines a security's price. Research by Professor Maureen O'Hara of Cornell University
and two others had shown that odd lots contributed, in some
stocks, to 30 percent of price discovery. Yet that information
was not being reported to the consolidated tape until Monday. O'Hara said in an e-mail she was pleased for getting
recognition for the study "What's Not There: Odd-Lot Bias in TAQ
Data," which was also co-authored by Chen Yao and Mao Ye, both
with the University of Illinois at the time. The odd-lot study raised questions about the fairness of
excluding trade information, which O'Hara said was content-rich,
to the 2.5 million subscribers of the consolidated tape. "Most academic research gets dismissed, so it is fun to have
a paper that actually changed a market," said O'Hara, a leading
academic in the study of how electronic markets work through
so-called signal processing.
