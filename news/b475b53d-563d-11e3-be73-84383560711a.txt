                       China has launched an antitrust probe against one of the world s biggest chipmakers, the US firm Qualcomm. 
         Qualcomm  said the probe  involved China s anti-monopoly law, but added that regulators told it the  substance of the investigation is confidential . 
         The firm said that it was  not aware or any charge  by the regulators that it had broken the law. 
         The probe comes as China has increased scrutiny of business practices that lead to higher prices for consumers.  
         In August, Chinese regulators levied a record fine of 670m yuan ($109m; Â£71m) on six foreign producers of baby milk formula for price-fixing. 
         China s National Development and Reform Commission, the body which is probing Qualcomm, also launched a pricing investigation into the pharmaceutical industry earlier this year.
