NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   Stocks were in a holding pattern Friday, as investors await the next signal from the Federal Reserve.    The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  was little changed in early trading. The Dow closed above  16,000  for the first time ever on Thursday. The  S P 500  and the  Nasdaq  were also flat.

     Since January, the Dow has climbed by 22%, the S P 500 is up by 26% and the Nasdaq has soared by 31%.     The Dow and the S P have hit record highs this year thanks in large part to the massive  stimulus program  administered by the  Fed , which has supported the economic recovery with monthly bond purchases.

He questioned how effective the stimulus has been and said it poses a "growing risk to financial stability," noting that many investors are increasingly worried that stocks are in  bubble territory .

Microsoft   ( MSFT ,  Fortune 500 )  will also be in focus as the company's new  Xbox One  goes on sale. This is Microsoft's first new gaming console in eight years.
