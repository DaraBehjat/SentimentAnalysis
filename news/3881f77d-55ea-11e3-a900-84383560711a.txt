                       The UK s economic recovery will take a  number of years , the Bank of England s chief economist Spencer Dale has said.  
         We had a very deep recession, we have a number of years to go,  Mr Dale told the BBC. 
         He also said that interest rates would remain low for what he termed a  sustained period .  
         But he thought the economy was moving in the right direction and did not foresee a housing market bubble. 
         He said:  We know that the housing market can quickly go from normal levels to overheating,  but that the UK is  not there now .  
         Spencer Dale sits on the Bank s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates.  
         On Wednesday, minutes from the  MPC s  November meeting showed the nine members all voted to leave interest rates at their current 0.5%.

		 The Bank of England s chief economist Spencer Dale talks to the BBC s Hugh Pym  
		 
    
		




       The Bank s plans for future interest rate rises have been closely watched since August when the governor, Mark Carney, said that he would not consider a rate rise until unemployment fell to 7%.  
         However, unemployment, the Bank said on Wednesday, has fallen faster than predicted, and the 7% level is not to be regarded as an automatic trigger for a rate hike.  
         Though Mr Dale warned that the recovery is not in its final stages, he stressed that things are improving.  
         This echoes comments from Wednesday s MPC minutes that the UK, in the Bank s view, is in a  sustained recovery  and does not face major inflation risks.
