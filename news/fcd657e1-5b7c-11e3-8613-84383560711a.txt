                       The chief executive of GrainCorp, Alison Watkins, has quit just days after Australia blocked a takeover bid for the company. 
         US conglomerate Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) had offered $3.4bn ($3.1bn; Â£1.9bn) to take over the firm. 
         But treasurer Joe Hockey blocked the deal, saying an acquisition  would not be in our national interest .   
         Ms Watkins said she had already planned to  leave the company at the time control passed over to ADM . 
         I have carefully weighed my options over the past two days,  Ms Watkins said. 
         Given last week s unexpected developments, I feel it is in the best interests of GrainCorp, our people and customers that I move on now and allow the board to find new leadership to take the business forward into its new phase. 
         GrainCorp is Australia s biggest grain merchant. ADM already owns about 20% of the firm. 
         As he blocked the takeover bid, Mr Hockey was quoted as saying by the Australian Broadcast Corporation that  now is not the right time for a 100% foreign acquisition of this key Australian business . 
         He said the industry was  going through transition  and it was not the right time to have the  major players foreign-owned . 
         GrainCorp s shares fell 3.5% in Sydney on Monday on the news of Ms Watkins leaving the firm.
