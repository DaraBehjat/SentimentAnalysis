		 Tui chief executive Peter Long says the growing cost of living means there is  strong demand  for all-inclusive holidays 
		 
    
		




                       Travel company Tui, which owns Thomson and First Choice, has seen profit slip due to weak French sales and a restructuring in its specialist and activity division. 
         Pre-tax profit for the year was £181m, down 10% on a year earlier, while revenue rose 4% to £15.1bn. However, excluding one-off costs, pre-tax profit rose 21%. 
         Chief executive Peter Long said it had been an  outstanding  year. 
         Tui said long term growth was on track. 
         Tui wrote off £188m in its specialist and activity division, which offers themed holidays, after a restructuring that resulted in it shutting down unprofitable lines of business as well as  a management change. 
         Now that this review is complete we are confident of delivering underlying annualised profit growth of 8-10%,  it said.  
         Meanwhile, it said its French division was hit by the weak economy there and low demand for North African holidays. Tui said it had now removed unprofitable routes and reduced its long-haul programme. 
         Overall, however Tui said it was confident it would meet its five year target of annual growth of between 7-10%. 
         It said trading for winter was  in line  with its expectations, with 60% of its programme already sold.  
         It also said it was  pleased  with summer 2014 trading, despite 2013 being a strong performance to follow.
