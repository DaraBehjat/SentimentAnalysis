   The beginning of Silk Air Road? 
 
I’d like to see Tesla’s Elon “Hyperloop” Musk and Amazon’s Jeff “Drone Delivery” Bezos face off in a cage match to determine who is the most interesting CEO in tech. Bezos upped his game by going on  60 Minutes  Sunday night and revealing a “secret R D project: ‘Octocopter’ drones that will fly packages directly to your doorstep in 30 minutes.” Yup, an autonomous drone delivery service that would use GPS coordinates to navigate, called Amazon “Prime Air.”  
After the shock and awe wore off, many commentators immediately pointed out that this is currently illegal. While the po-po and government entities are allowed to fly drones if they obtain authorization from the FAA, private use of drones is limited to hobbyists, and they have to keep the drones under 400 feet and within their line of sight. But that’s just a temporary hang-up. Congress  has ordered the FAA  to clear the skyway for commercial use of drones by 2015. So, yes, Amazon will be able to get emergency diapers, toilet paper, or  5-pound gummy bears  (depending on the Octocopter’s weight limits) to you in 30 minutes (and Google will be able to launch ‘Drone Map’, and Facebook will be able to launch ‘Drone Stalk’, and on and on).  
Law enforcement may already be gritting its teeth over the idea of legal drone delivery though. Being able to send things by drone could be hugely disruptive to the existing mail system: a peer-to-peer postal service that cuts out the USPS and FedEx. That’s fine when Amazon is shipping out books, but what about the kind of deliveries that law enforcement wants to be able to track? The existing postal system is full of surveillance.  
When you drop off a package at an  automated postal machine , it takes a photo of you and keeps it on file for 30 days. That can help law enforcement figure out  who sent a package full of drugs . If online drug bazaar Silk Road had had autonomous drones making its drug deliveries instead of the normal postal service, there would likely be a few less vendors under arrest.  
In addition, the postal system  logs all mail  for law enforcement, scanning the information on the outside of letters and parcels before they are delivered. And if they have a warrant, or if it’s crossing a border, they can open it. That scanning  helped law enforcement track  ricin-laced letters sent to Michael Bloomberg and President Obama back to a C-level actress in Texas.  
Drones are currently technologically limited, at least when we’re talking about the non-weapon enabled variety. The Octocopter-type drone favored by Amazon can usually only fly for about 30 minutes to an hour with a limited distance. Forget about the “neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night” postman creed. As of now, these drones would likely not stand up to inclement weather. But the technology will surely improve, and they will be able to make longer and more robust journeys. If drones took off (heh) as a private way to send packages and letters over short or long distances, law enforcement would lose an important crime-fighting tool: their surveillance of the mail system. Much like electronic communication has gone “dark” thanks to encryption tools, the postal system could go “dark” thanks to private robot postmen.  
This may sound far-fetched, but private, illicit drone deliveries are already happening. Last month, three men and a woman  were caught  smuggling tobacco into a Georgia prison. They used an Octocopter to do it. Unfortunately for them, their drone wasn’t an autonomous one and they had to crouch in the woods near the prison yard and watch the flight of their copter with binoculars. If it had been an autonomous drone, they may well have gotten a way with the crime, and the smugglers wouldn’t be facing up to 20 years in their drone delivery zone for crossing prison guard lines with contraband.
