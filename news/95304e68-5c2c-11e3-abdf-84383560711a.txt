Dec 3 (Reuters) - China Mobile Ltd, the world's
largest mobile phone carrier, has quietly begun taking
pre-orders for Apple Inc's iPhones, according to a
report on Fortune.com. 
China is critical to Apple's growth prospects, being its
biggest market after the United States. Apple fell to No. 7 in
the second quarter in China, with a 5 percent market share,
losing ground not just to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 
but also to Chinese rivals Lenovo and ZTE Corp
. The Fortune report, which could not be confirmed immediately
by Reuters, showed a screen grab from a reservation website of a
China Mobile subsidiary in southern China that began taking
pre-orders for the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5c late on Monday.
() As of 6:30 a.m. EST on Tuesday (7:30 p.m. Beijing time), the
page had been replaced with a notice saying it was being updated
and pre-orders would resume later. Representatives for China Mobile could not be reached
immediately for comment. Apple was also not immediately
available. In late October, China Mobile put an advertisement for the
faster 4G mobile network on its website, raising expectations
that a long-awaited distribution deal with Apple would be
announced soon. Apple has spent years trying to reach a deal with China
Mobile, with numerous visits to the state-owned carrier's
Beijing headquarters, and it has repeated insisted the Chinese
market is crucial to the company. The ongoing effort has fueled Wall Street hopes that a deal
would come soon, offering the iPhone to more than 740 million
potential buyers.
