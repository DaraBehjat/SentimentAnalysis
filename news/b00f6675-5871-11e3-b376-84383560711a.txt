	 Cold weather hits B Q owner s profit 

		 


								 
	 
                       Shares in Kingfisher, the owner of DIY chains B Q and Screwfix, have fallen 5% after the group reported lower-than-expected profits for the third quarter. 
         Despite  a very strong performance  from Screwfix, group chief executive Ian Cheshire said markets  remain challenging .  
         Group retail profit was £271m (325.6m euros) for the 13 weeks to 2 November, up 1.7% on the same period last year.   
         Analysts were expecting about £280m. Group sales were up 1.4% to £2.9bn. 
         I remain enthusiastic about our longer-term prospects,  Mr Cheshire added. 
         UK and Ireland sales rose 3.7% to £1.1bn over the period, helping retail profit grow 8.3% to £63m.  
         Screwfix saw its sales grow 21.1% - or 11.1% after stripping out the effect of new store openings - to £180m. 
         Its performance improved due to extended opening hours, new store openings, and  the successful introduction of a mobile click, pay and collect offer last year,  the company said. 
         Kingfisher also owns Castorama and Brico Depot in France. 
         Despite France s  weak market , total sales there were up 1.9%, the company said.  
         Kingfisher also operates the Koctas brand, a 50% joint venture in Turkey with the Koc Group. 
         It also has a 21% interest in Hornbach, a German DIY retailer.
