                       Profits for the global airline industry will reach a record $19.7bn (Â£12bn) in 2014, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said. 
         The prediction is an upgrade on IATA s previous forecast of profits of $16.4bn. 
         The Geneva-based trade body said  cost cutting, cheaper fuel and rising demand for travel were behind its upgrade.  
         IATA also upgraded its profit estimate for this year to $12.9bn from an earlier estimate of $11.7bn. 
         However, IATA said that while total profits were rising, profit margins were being squeezed. 
         It said next year s estimated profit of $19.7bn would come from predicted revenues of $743bn, whereas the previous record profit figure of $19.2bn - recorded in 2010 - came from revenues of $579bn. 
         IATA chief executive Tony Tyler said:  It is a tough environment in which to run an airline. Competition is intense and yields are deteriorating. 
         Cargo volumes haven t grown since 2010 and cargo revenues are back at 2007 levels. The passenger business is expanding more robustly. 
         Mr Tyler added that airlines would  only make  a net profit of about $5.94 per passenger in 2014.  
         IATA represents 240 airlines which cover 84% of total air traffic.
