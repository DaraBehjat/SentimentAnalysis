By MIT Technology Review Custom, an Energy Realities Partner  
Offshore oil rigs are a crucial part of the world’s energy ecosystem, and produce a significant percentage of the world’s crude oil. But most people only think about these giant advanced engineering marvels when something goes wrong with one of them, and few have ever set foot on one.  
Now visitors to the United States Gulf Coast may visit their choice of two used oil rigs which have been turned into museums, giving them the chance to get a sense of what daily life is like on these floating cities.  
The Ocean Star Offshore Drilling Rig Museum in Galveston, Texas, is a retired jackup oil rig that has become one of the area’s most popular tourist attractions. About 250 miles away, in Morgan City, Louisiana, which is 85 miles west of New Orleans, sits “Mr. Charlie,” an older rig that was in operation from 1954 to 1986.  
Visitors to the Galveston facility can get a sense of daily life on a rig, and see the constantly improving and quite complex technology used to draw crude oil from an ocean floor that is often several thousand feet below.  
The Galveston museum tells the story of offshore drilling for oil and gas on three floors filled with exhibits and interactive displays. Every aspect of offshore drilling is covered, from seismic technology to exploration and production. There are scale models of the several different varieties of offshore rigs, along with actual examples of rig technology such as drill bits and remotely-operated vehicles. Safety, on the minds of nearly all visitors ever since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which occurred about 450 miles away in the Gulf, is also the subject of exhibits  
This rig is a popular attraction: more than 85% of the 170 reviews of the museum on TripAdvisor, a popular travel site, rate the museum as either Excellent or Very good.  
The emphasis at the Mr. Charlie museum is more historical, which is logical because the rig was one of the first of its kind. By today’s standards, with rigs reaching ocean depths of over a mile, Mr. Charlie isn’t very impressive, since it was able only to reach an ocean floor 40 feet away. But by helping to prove during the early 1950s that the concept of offshore drilling was sound, Mr. Charlie was instrumental in opening up the Gulf of Mexico, and indeed the coastal waters of the entire world, to offshore drilling.  
That was quite an accomplishment: offshore oil today accounts for about 30% of the world’s oil and about half of its natural gas. There are close to 900 rigs in operation in different parts of the world, with their output constantly shifting as oil fields become tapped out.  
The technology behind offshore drilling continues to improve. Not only are rigs ever more advanced, but the use of extremely large ships, floating production storage and offloading vessels called FPSOs, is also growing. These vessels can operate much further out at sea than rigs can, and they are becoming a form of deepwater oil production that is furnishing an increasingly important part of the global oil supply. Deepwater production is predicted to reach 16% by 2016, up from just 9% a few years back.  
But those sorts of statistics of energy production aren’t the chief attraction for thousands of annual visitors to the rigs, many of them with school groups. Most are there for an educational experience, though for some, it’s also a career development opportunity. The Ocean Star offers a seven-hour class in the basics of the petroleum industry, for those thinking about making rigs not just an outing, but also their life’s work.
