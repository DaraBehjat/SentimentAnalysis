NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   Stocks were flat Monday as some investors may be worrying about retailers and the broader economy following a lackluster Black Friday.    The  Dow Jones industrial average , the  S P 500  and the  Nasdaq  were all little changed. The S P 500 ended a holiday shortened session Friday at a new high.

     The  National Retail Federation  reported that shoppers spent an average of 4% less over the holiday weekend, the first decline in spending since 2009. Shares of  J.C.

Amazon   ( AMZN ,  Fortune 500 )  made headlines after CEO Jeff Bezos said the company is exploring a  drone-based delivery system  for some shipments. The plan is in the early stages and faces regulatory hurdles, but investors on StockTwits seemed pleased with the attention it generated.     "Congrats to  $AMZN  #Amazon for their drone buzz. .In all media now," said  ForexAccountManagers .     But shares of Amazon gave up early gains and turned lower at midday. Some investors were questioning whether the Prime Air delivery service makes economic sense.     "$AMZN #Amazon probably down,because people who saw 60 MIN,figured this bezo dude is nuts I mean really?there going to fly 1K's of drones?LOL," said  1991previa.      But one trader joked that they liked how enthusiastic Bezos is. One wished for more of that from  Apple    ( AAPL ,  Fortune 500 ) CEO Tim Cook.     " $AMZN  bezos is the biggest cheerleader for his company. i wish tim cook would do the same=show more excitement," said  deskpros123.      Still, shares of the iPhone and iPad maker have bounced back recently. The stock has clawed back from about $400 over the summer and now trades above $550.     Shares of  eBay   ( EBAY ,  Fortune 500 )  were lifted by hopes the online auction company will benefit as consumers look for bargains this holiday season.     vidConfig.push({ videoArray : [ {id : "/video/investing/2013/12/02/i-b-ebay-wins-black-friday.cnnmoney", hed: "eBay wins on Black Friday"} ], playerprofile : 'story', playerid : 'cvp_0', divid : 'vid0', hedtarget : '#cnnplayer0 .cnnHeadline' });                    eBay wins on Black Friday          "I'm going to do all my shopping today on  $EBAY  - every little bit counts!" said  crosenfield .
