One of the biggest challenges early-stage companies face is capturing the key initial customers that vet their technology and lend credibility in the market. These usually large organizations, known as anchor customers, may also be key partners that often accelerate commercialization.  
The problem is that many small and mid-size businesses find it extremely difficult to engage larger companies,  as I discussed previously . It can take months of preparation before they are ready to meet with key decision makers at potential anchor companies. I have explained these preparations and now would like to provide some insights on how to effectively engage an anchor customer.  
It’s a five-step process:  
1. Define a Commercialization Pathway  
If you’re running an early-stage company, you can go one of three routes to commercialize your product: (1) you can “go it alone,” (2) you can partner with others or (3) you can sell your IP or equity.  
It is important to evaluate these options carefully before you engage an anchor customer because that will affect who to target, what you want out of the relationship, and how to conduct your meetings.  
Defining your best commercialization pathway involves assessing your capabilities in areas like product development, funding sources, market access and production scale-up. If you have significant gaps in light of your goals, you may seek strategic partners or sell some of your assets.  
Ask yourself: Which of the commercialization areas require attention? Do I have the capital to develop these capabilities? Can I find these capabilities in an anchor customer? The goal of any partnership should be to fill your competency gaps and meet your goals for timing, growth, cash flow, etc.  
2. Select the Anchor Customer  
The right anchor customer for your business is one who provides needed capabilities and itself benefits from the relationship. Determining who meets these criteria is a critical step. Thankfully, you have already done your homework in the  in-house research  and  voice of the customer  (VOC) activities I outlined previously. Based on that knowledge, rank potential anchor customers from best to poorest match.  
The next step is to create a detailed report on your target anchor customer that puts all the relevant information you’ve gathered into a useful structure. Having as much organized information as possible is crucial, since early-stage companies typically get only one shot with an anchor customer.  
An effective report includes information on the anchor customer’s overall profile, product and business data relevant to your offering, and a history of the target company’s relationships with third parties. If you did not collect some of this information during the market opportunity assessment activities, consult the target company’s financial statements, public investment assessments and published news items. If new information reveals a poor fit, you’ll have to start over.  
3. Sell the Engagement Meeting   
Capturing the attention of potential anchor customers and persuading them to meet, requires skills and practice. Unlike VOC interviews, this is a sales activity. You need a clear scheduling strategy and must know who you are talking to and what your “hook” is.  
It is helpful to prepare a scheduling script based on the anchor customer report. It should include an opening that clearly states who you are and a hook that explains why you want to talk to the company and what’s in it for them. Don’t forget to confirm you are speaking with the right person, have preferred meeting dates and times in mind, and remember to confirm all logistics at the end of the call.  
The first 30 seconds of your call are crucial. Be concise and professional. Reference shared connections or previous interactions, if possible. Decide beforehand if you want to ask for a non-disclosure agreement. Remember that it can be a turn-off and could be construed as distrust.  
Before you pick up the phone, practice, practice, practice.
