HOUSTON  Dec 11 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said
on Wednesday that the reversed Houston-to-Houma pipeline was
being filled with crude in anticipation of a mid-December
startup. 
Spokeswoman Destin Singleton said that preparation included
crude linefill with "product flowing and movement." The reversal is expected to help relieve a bottleneck
emerging in the Houston area by moving growing output from Texas
shale and tight oil fields and supply from the U.S. crude
futures hub Cushing, Oklahoma, to Louisiana refineries.
