                      comments       Nasdaq topped 4,000.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   The  Nasdaq  briefly topped 4,000 Monday for the first time since September 2000, but failed to close above that key level.    And while the tech-heavy Nasdaq did cross a big milestone, it is still well below its peak of above 5,000, which was set in March 2000.

     The  Dow  managed to log another record closing high though, while the  S P 500  finished in the red after hitting a new all-time high earlier in the day.     Stocks ended mixed as investors took in a disappointing report on the housing market. Pending home sales dropped 0.6% in October from the prior month. That was the fifth straight decline. Economists expected a 1.3% increase. The housing recovery has been a big boon for the stock market this year, so signs of weakness are worrisome.     Meanwhile, investors seemed encouraged by a landmark deal reached between Iran and the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany over the weekend.     As part of the  agreement , world powers will relax economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for a promise that the country scales back its nuclear program.  Oil prices  sank on the expectation of  more oil exports  from Iran following the  nuclear deal .     World markets also climbed on the news.  European markets  finished with solid gains, with Germany's benchmark  Dax  index leading the way. Most  Asian markets  ended higher, with Japan's  Nikkei  jumping 1.5% as the yen weakened against the dollar.

Trading volume is expected to be low during this holiday-shortened week and there are few economic and earnings reports on tap. U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and will shut at 1 p.m. ET on Friday.     In company news,  Wal-Mart   ( WMT ,  Fortune 500 )  announced that current CEO of Wal-mart International D oug McMillon will replace CEO Mike Duke,  who plans to retire early next year. Shares rose and hit an all-time high.      Apple   ( AAPL ,  Fortune 500 )  bought the Israeli tech company PrimeSense, a leading developer of 3D sensors. Apple's stock was up about 1%.      Yahoo   ( YHOO ,  Fortune 500 )  announced that K atie Couric  will join the company early next year as its "global anchor."     vidConfig.push({ videoArray : [ {id : "/video/investing/2013/11/25/investing-buzz-nasdaq-4000-tech-bubble.cnnmoney", hed: "Nasdaq 4000: Tech bubble?

Not yet          Social media stocks were trading lower, a sign that the hot sector may be losing momentum.     Shares of  Yelp   ( YELP ) , which have more than tripled this year, were down almost 7%.  Facebook   ( FB ,  Fortune 500 )  shares, which have more than doubled so far in 2013, slid 3%.      Twitter   ( TWTR ) , which just debuted on the stock market earlier this month, tumbled nearly 5%.  LinkedIn   ( LNKD ) ,  Groupon   ( GRPN )  and  Pandora   ( P )  were also all down sharply. That put pressure on the  Global X Social Media Index ETF   ( SOCL ) .     "Looks like social media bubble officially popping ...  $SOCL ,  $FB ,  $LNKD ,  $TWTR ,  $P ,  $YELP  Bearish," said StockTwits trader  slowslimslider .     Another user,  ACInvestorBlog , noted that the fall of some "bubble stocks" could mean that  Netflix   ( NFLX )  and  Amazon   ( AMZN ,  Fortune 500 )  could be next to face pressure. Netflix has surged 275% this year, while Amazon is up almost 50%.     "Some bubble stocks falling from grace  $FB   $TWTR   $YELP   $TSLA , he said. "Watch  $NFLX  and  $AMZN ."     But some traders remained bullish on Facebook. One noted that Facebook's stock has enjoyed a sharp rally to its current level of around $45.     " $FB  Keep in mind wasn't too long ago 26 was norm,"  IncrementalWealth  said. "A 50% jump in a few months. Watching for lower as said all along then back in big again. Bullish."
