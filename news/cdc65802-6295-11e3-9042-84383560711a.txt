                       British shoppers are contributing to food waste problems by only selecting  perfect  produce, says Tesco. 
         Speaking on Tuesday at a House of Lords inquiry into food waste, Matt Simister of the supermarket giant said domestic consumers were unwilling to consider imperfect fruit and vegetables. 
         UK customers picked the  cream of the crop , unlike their counterparts in central and eastern Europe, he said.  
         Supermarkets could do more to address the problem, he added.  
         Mr Simister, food sourcing director at Tesco, was speaking alongside his counterpart from Waitrose. 
         He told the House of Lords  European Union sub-committee on agriculture that he was looking at options to encourage people to buy the  old, ugly, misshapen  fruit and vegetables that tend to go to waste.  
   
   

     Customers should be educated to buy  old, ugly, misshapen  fruit and vegetables, says Tesco 
   
       When asked whether product standards were too high, he said that Tesco would look at putting  more misshapen products through our value range at better prices .  
   'Wonky carrot' 
	       There are opportunities to do more in this area,  he said.  
         Mr Simister added that Tesco used different products for its central European markets.  
         We are, in many cases, taking class one products into the UK and class two into central and eastern European food markets. 
         Tesco could put  the wonky carrot  into circulation, he said.

	        Earlier this year, Tesco said it was dropping some food promotions after disclosing that two-thirds of produce grown for bagged salad was wasted.  
         In the first figures of their type to be published, Tesco said that 68% of salad to be sold in bags was thrown out - 35% of it in the home. 
   Confusion 
	       It has also moved to a  one-date  system to stop customer confusion between display dates and use-by dates. 
         Tesco revealed that it had generated almost 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of 2013. Of that total, 21% was made up of fruit and vegetables and 41% of bakery items. 
         In November, the publicly-funded recycling group the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) said that British families threw away about Â£60 a month worth of food per household.  
   
   

     UK consumers choose  perfect  looking produce, like these apples 
   
       That is equivalent to six meals per week in food waste.  
         Wrap said that buying too much, serving large portions and confusion over food labelling were the main causes. 
         In 2008, the EU scrapped  controversial rules  that prevented the sale of oddly-sized or misshapen fruit and vegetables.
