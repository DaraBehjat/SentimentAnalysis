          What's Next               comments       Sterling's dazzling run not over yet   By Virginia Harrison   @vharrisoncnn     December 4, 2013: 9:15 AM ET               The U.K. economy - and its currency - are Europe's standout performers this year.          LONDON (CNNMoney)   The British pound has been on a tear and analysts predict it will push even higher this year.    That could create an uncomfortable reality for the U.K. as a high currency threatens to dampen one of Europe's most impressive recovery stories.

     This week  sterling  streaked past a two-year high against the U.S. dollar to trade at nearly $1.64. It has also risen against the euro and is now worth â‚¬1.2 .      DailyFX currency analyst Christopher Vecchio says the pound could trade as high as $1.68 in the next three months.     Growing confidence in the  U.K. economy , which pulled back from the brink of a triple-dip recession earlier this year, has helped boost sterling's appeal.     The world's sixth largest economy has been one of the best performers in  Europe.      But a sustained rush to sterling may stoke concern over the impact of a stronger currency on the broader recovery.     A high currency tends to weigh on exporters as foreign buyers have to pay more for their goods.     So far a stronger pound hasn't hurt Britain's consumer-led rebound. Spending is rising and manufacturing and construction activity is improving. Recovery in  housing markets  prompted the Bank of England to end cheap bank funding for new mortgages last week.

Back in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast annual growth of 1.8% in 2014, and 2.3% in 2015 for the U.K. IHS chief U.K. economist Howard Archer expects the OBR to hike its estimate for 2014 to 2.5%.     Thursday's statement will coincide with the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting.     Despite adopting a more upbeat growth outlook in recent months, analysts anticipate the central bank will maintain current interest rate settings.     Under the Bank's policy of  forward guidance  the benchmark rate will be frozen until unemployment drops to 7% from its current level of 7.6%.

Western Union Business Solutions analyst Nawaz Ali said he expects Governor Mark Carney to respond to sterling strength "sooner rather than later."     "Carney is a big communicator to markets and a signal that sterling is overvalued is a strong possibility over the coming months," Ali said.     Ali said other  central banks  have acted to insulate exporters from overheated currencies. At the same time, the Bank of England is getting ahead of its  European , Japanese and U.S. counterparts in its shift toward tighter monetary policy.     vidConfig.push({ videoArray : [ {id : "/video/news/2013/09/11/n-plastic-money-cash-notes-bank-of-england.cnnmoney", hed: "Why plastic cash is the future"} ], playerprofile : 'story', playerid : 'cvp_0', divid : 'vid0', hedtarget : '#cnnplayer0 .cnnHeadline' });                    Why plastic cash is the future          Global policy action will continue to be a key factor in determining sterling's future course, most significantly, a decision by the  Federal Reserve  on when to begin scaling back its $85 billion monthly bond purchases -- or quantitative easing.     As long as the Fed continues buying at its current pace, the  U.K. currency  is likely to benefit.     "If QE stays in place then the pound is the top candidate to continue to gain steadily," DailyFX's Vecchio said.               First Published: December 4, 2013: 9:15 AM ET
