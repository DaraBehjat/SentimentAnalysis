                       The gap between imports and exports of goods narrowed in October, according to the  Office for National Statistics (ONS). 
         The ONS said the goods trade deficit narrowed to £9.7bn, compared with £10.1bn in September.  
         Including services, in which the UK traditionally has a surplus, the overall trade deficit was unchanged from September at £2.6bn. 
         Separate ONS data brought positive news from the manufacturing sector.  
         The ONS said the  UK Index of production , one of the key components of gross domestic product, grew by  0.4% in the month, in line with forecasts. Compared with October 2012 it was up 3.2%. 
         The manufacturing of transport equipment was the biggest force behind the increase. 
         The rise marks a slowdown from the 0.9% rise in September when production bounced back from a weak August, the ONS said. 
         ING economist Rob Carnell said the data was positive.  This will provide a robust starting point for the fourth quarter and bodes well for fourth quarter GDP if not undermined by the service sector - which we think unlikely,  he added.
