                       A little over a year after its stock market debut, Facebook  has joined  the S P 500 index of some of the world s largest firms, replacing test equipment maker Teradyne. 
         Companies in the S P 500 can be listed on either the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange. 
         The S P 500 is considered the best representation of the US stock market and a bellwether for the US economy. 
         Facebook shares jumped 4% after hours on the news. 
         After a botched public offering in May 2012, Facebook shares slid to less than half of their initial $38 (£23; 28 euro) price, before recovering during the summer of 2013. 
         The company has been pleasing investors recently, notching better than expected earnings and strong mobile advertising sales, a crucial metric watched by analysts. 
         It is now worth a little over $122bn (£74bn). 
         Other firms added to the S P 500 are Alliance Data Systems and flooring company Mohawk Industries. 
         They replace retailer Abercrombie   Fitch and JDS Uniphase, a maker of optical technology.
