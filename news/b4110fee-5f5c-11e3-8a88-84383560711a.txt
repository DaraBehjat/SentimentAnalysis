       The firm was on course to return £568m in dividend payments to shareholders by September 2015, he said. 
   Rapid expansion 
	       Some of Berkeley s flagship schemes include the Riverlight development near Battersea Power Station and 190 Strand in central London. 
         Over the last five years Berkeley has doubled the size of its business, investing over £1.5bn into land and over £2.5bn into build, sustaining 16,000 direct and indirect jobs each year and building over 15,000 homes of every tenure in vibrant new places,  said Mr Pidgley. 
         Berkeley s shares rose nearly 9% in early morning trading and have risen more than 50% in a year.  
         Earlier this week, research company Markit said domestic building activity was at its fastest for 10 years.  
         Markit s purchasing managers  index for the construction sector rose to 62.6 in November, up from 59.4 in October. The higher the reading above 50, the stronger the growth in activity.
