This rebound has been driven by a number of favorable trends, including M A (e.g., UAL and Continental, US Air and AMR, which have reduced competition and firmed pricing power); labor cuts that have reduced costs (e.g., Delta); and a reviving global economy that has boosted air traffic.  
Still, most airline stocks trade at low multiples, ranging from 7 to 13.56, and operating revenues and margins continue to rise (see table). That’s why some investment analysts continue to like the sector.  
Barron’s  Jack Hough , for instance, likes Delta, which he includes in a list of turnaround stocks. “The company has cut its workforce and renegotiated worker contracts, added additional lucrative international routes, and improved customer service. It has also trimmed debt, reaching its goal of getting below $10 billion and setting a new target for $7 billion,” writes Hough.  
One of these lucrative routes is New York-Athens Greece, where Delta is the only airline that flies directly.  
I also like the sector, for another reason: the rapid decline in oil prices, following a nuclear deal between US and Iran. But with a 200 percent gain, I’ll be very careful before  I chase Delta’s stock. Instead, I like United Continental, which dominates the lucrative Asian routes; JetBlue, which dominates lucrative domestic routes; and US Airways group, which is about to reap the benefits of its merger with American Airlines.

A few words of caution: The airline industry is a high-risk industry at the whim of business cycles, oil price spikes, unions, regulators, and terrorists. Hype should never be a substitute for due diligence. Prudent investors should consider hedging their positions by writing puts.
