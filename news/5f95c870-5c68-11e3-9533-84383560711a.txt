JC Penney's   JC Penney's  same store sales were up 10.1% in November compared to the same period last year, the long embattled retailer announced this afternoon.  
The surge is just the second time in 23 months that the company’s sales grew. The first time was in October when the increase was just .9%.  
Strong Black Friday and web sales drove the new found success.  
“The traffic and conversion we saw both in stores and online this weekend was exciting for everyone across our organization,” said CEO Mike Ullman in a statement. “We know the environment will remain as competitive as ever, and we are all working to maintain our momentum through the Holiday season.”  
The company has long struggled to keep up with the competition, and has been running through CEOs and sale strategies for years. Less than two weeks ago the stock was  taken out of the S P 500  and into the S P MidCap 400. Following the rare good news JC Penney shares were up more that 5% to $10.64 in after hours trading. Shares are down 42.3% year-over-year but been improving since the  October sales  beat.  
Late last month, however, the retailer posted a worse then expected $401 million  third quarter loss . So the question remains if the company is sacrificing profits for better-looking sales numbers. In its monthly look at retail clients’ trading activity,  TD Ameritrade Holding   TD Ameritrade Holding  found that JC Penney stock was one of the biggest movers in October. But the activity was concentrated to a few days with active traders swooping in when the stock hit its 52-week low, leading to speculation the investors were largely bottom fishing.
