HONG KONG  Dec 2 (Reuters) - Gambling revenue in the
southern Chinese territory of Macau jumped 21.3 percent on year
in November after events including an international boxing match
and annual Grand Prix motor race led to an increase in visitors.

fourth highest this year, showed government data released on
Monday. Analysts had forecast a median growth of 20 percent. Macau is China's only legal gambling hub with 35 casinos and
8 in the works, operated by companies such as Sands China Ltd
, Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd, Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd, MGM China Holdings Ltd
, SJM Holdings Ltd and Wynn Macau Ltd
. Macau is one of the world's fastest-growing economies thanks
to the gambling industry.
