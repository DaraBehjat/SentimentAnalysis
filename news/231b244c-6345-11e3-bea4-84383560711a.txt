NEW YORK (CNNMoney)    The foreclosure crisis is showing signs that it's finally fading away.    The number of new foreclosure filings -- which includes default notices, auctions and bank repossessions -- dropped 15% to a total of 113,454 properties in November, according to RealtyTrac, an online marketer of foreclosed properties.

       That was the biggest monthly decline since November 2010, and foreclosure filings are now at the lowest level since December 2006. From a year ago, filings are down 37%.

"People have more to lose if they lose their home," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia.

And certain markets, like Florida, Delaware, Maryland and South Carolina, are still struggling with high rates of foreclosures.     "While foreclosures will likely continue to stage a weak rally in certain markets next year as the last of the distress left over from the Great Recession is dealt with, it is highly unlikely that there will be a foreclosure comeback that poses any major threat to the solid housing recovery that has now taken hold," said Blomquist.      -- CNNMoney's James O'Toole contributed to this report.
