NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   Stocks rose again Monday, as the market continued to cheer Friday's better-than-expected jobs report as well as some notable mergers.    The  Dow Jones Industrial Average ,  S P 500  and  Nasdaq  all moved slightly higher. The S P 500 was just a few points from hitting a new record high.

     The  strong jobs report  showed the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7% in November -- the lowest level in five years -- as more people said they were getting jobs and joining the labor force.  Markets surged , with the  Dow  rallying by nearly 200 points.     And there was more positive news for the global economy over the weekend in the form of the first  major world trade  deal in nearly 20 years.

Shares of American Airlines group were up about 3% in early afternoon trading after surging 9% out of the gate. The deal, which cleared a series of legal hurdles, including an antitrust lawsuit this fall from the Justice Department and a last-minute challenge from a consumer group, was inked Monday morning before the opening bell.

But one trader on StockTwits was skeptical that the merger would muster approval from anti-trust regulators.     "The Feds will never allow this merger to come to fruition.  Sysco : move on. Improve your bottom line through organic growth!" said  abc3000 .     Another trader disagreed and said the deal would be a big plus for the company.     "$ SYY  now controls the prime beef market for restaurants and hotels which belonged to US Foods. big margins in that stuff." said  JnyLunchBkt       McDonald's   ( MCD ,  Fortune 500 )  fell more than 1% as the fast food chain reported a drop in U.S. sales for November.

What really has changed?" said  momomiester .     Shares of  Baidu   ( BIDU ) , China's largest search engine, were also up, and the stock was among the top trending tickers on StockTwits. Like Twitter, there was no news to explain the move. But it appears that momentum is on its side. Shares are up more than 70% this year.     "looks like the herd got it right on  $BIDU ," said  1nvestor .
