                       The European Central Bank (ECB) has kept its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.25%. 
         The decision follows its surprise cut from 0.5% in November. 
         ECB president Mario Draghi said the decision to keep the rate at its current level reflected the fact that the eurozone s economy remained  subdued . 
         The eurozone - the 17 countries that use the euro currency - grew by 0.1% in the July-to-September period. 
         This compares with 0.3% growth in the previous quarter. 
         In a news conference following the announcement, Mr Draghi confirmed the ECB s forward guidance that the interest rate would remain at the same level or lower for the foreseeable future. 
         Prices remained  subdued , he said, despite the recent increase in the eurozone inflation rate from 0.7% to 0.9%. 
         Our monetary policy decisions are taking time to make their influence felt,  he said. 
         The ECB has reduced its benchmark interest rate consistently since 2008, when it stood at 3.75%, in response to the region s sustained debt crisis and contracting economy. 
         This refinancing rate determines what banks pay to borrow from the ECB and influences borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
