Yesterday, lawyers for Kurt Mix filed a formal Rule 29 motion to have the case for obstruction of justice thrown out prior to the defense starting its case.  On Thursday afternoon, without the jury present, U.S. District Judge Sandwood Duval Jr. allowed the prosecution and defense to give their oral arguments for and against dismissal of the case.  
The government’s case against Mix was presented by assistant U.S. attorney Jennifer Saulino, who must convince the jury that Mix was knowingly obstructing justice by deleting text message strings associated with the  BP   BP  Oil spill in 2010.  Her theory is that Mix was thinking, “I have a lot of candid text messages on there [iPhone].  I’m not sure that I want the Grand Jury to see those candid text messages because I know I didn’t actually toe the party line so well in those text messages.  So he got rid of them.”  That is the government’s version of what went down with Kurt Mix … that is the case that can put Mix in prison for years … that is what Saulino wants a jury to believe.  Should that theory fail, Saulino reminded judge Duval that, “… admission [deleting text string in this case], in and of itself, means the government doesn’t have to prove it [obstruction]“.  If that were the case, then they should have marched Mix out on the first day when his own lawyer admitted as much…but they did not.  
Saulino gave a hint about the government’s frustration with the entire BP spill and, perhaps why they targeted Mix when she said, “… the government was prevented from telling the jury the most key fact about the flow rate, which is that BP pled guilty to lying about it.”  So if “BP” lied, someone, some individual, MUST be held accountable … and that poor soul was Kurt Mix.  
Mix’s defense was, and has been, a bit more believable.  Arguing on behalf of Mix was  Aaron Katz of Ropes   Gray .  Katz argued that what the jury has heard was a lot about “BP” and even heard from a government scientist who testified about a meeting that Kurt Mix never attended … but they have heard little about obstruction of justice, the charges that Mix is facing.  When the jury did hear the prosecution’s version of obstruction, Katz said, “The jury would have to assume that Kurt Mix is either the absolute worst obstructor of all time, or that he’s borderline incompetent.”  There is no evidence that Mix covered anything up and there is less evidence that he was even nervous about anything other than stopping the spill of oil into the Gulf.  The government never even asked one of the recipients of the texts which were deleted to testify.  
Judge Duval must now make a decision whether to dismiss this case.  If he grants the motion, then the charges will be dropped and Mix could not be tried again, so this is a big deal.  Duval’s decision is based on whether, “… viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, whether the evidence could be accepted by a a jury as adequate and sufficient to support the conclusion of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.”  What a jury must believe is that Mix, in a conspiracy of one, took it upon himself to hide some innocuous text messages to obscure facts about an oil flow rate for one of this countries largest manmade disasters.  
We all respect our courts and everyone wants justice.  Justice in this case is knowing that the government went after the wrong guy and the sooner they realize it, the sooner they can go after some real bad guys.  Katz summed that up when he said in the hearing, “… as an American citizen, I cannot believe that my Department of Justice thinks that that is the case that can go to the jury.  I cannot believe it.”  Well the Department of Justice prosecutors believe it, it has yet to be determined in the Department of Justice judge believes it.  
Judge Duval has promised to make a ruling prior to the jury deliberating on Monday.  About his pending decision he told the respective lawyers, “The Court has its own obligations and my ruling may be ultimately one that neither of you can believe as an American citizen or a lawyer.”  
Trial resumes today as the defense calling three witnesses before closing its case … closing arguments on Monday.
