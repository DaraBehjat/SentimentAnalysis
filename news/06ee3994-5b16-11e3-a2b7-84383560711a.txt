   Amazon is testing a drone to deliver customer packages within 30 minutes.  (Screen capture from an Amazon.com video) 
 
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos unveiled a new plan by Amazon to deliver packages to customer’s homes within 30 minutes using drones.  The plan was announced on the CBS show 60 minutes, and Amazon has since posted a video (embedded below) and Frequently Asked Questions page.  
The biggest obstacle for Amazon may not be technological, but rather legal.  The company claims to be ready to launch in 2015, so long as the FAA’s rules allow for them to enable air delivery.  Currently small drones like those Amazon plans to use, are not permitted to fly in U.S. airspace without special permission.  The FAA’s primary concerns regarding drones in U.S. airspace revolve around safety, particularly the drone’s inability to sense and avoid other aircraft.  However, some groups are also concerned with the  privacy implications  of drones equipped with cameras.  
 
In early November, the FAA released a “roadmap” detailing the wider use of drones in U.S. airspace.  That document outlined the “regulations, technologies, standards and policies” needed for integrating drones into the national airspace.  
The FAA is concerned with a host of issues within the agency’s regulatory purview.  Prior to allowing drones to operate in the national airspace, the FAA must develop rules for pilot/operator training, control station policies and certification requirements, issues related to the drone’s data link and communication capabilities, airworthiness standards and other issues to include:  
 
  Developing minimum standards for Sense and Avoid (SAA), Control and Communications (C2), and separation assurance to meet new or existing operational and regulatory requirements for specified airspace;  
  Understanding the privacy, security, and environmental implications of UAS operations and working with relevant departments and agencies to proactively coordinate and align these considerations with the UAS regulatory structure;  
  And developing acceptable UAS design standards that consider the aircraft size, performance, mode of control, intended operational environment, and mission criticality.  
 
While aviation regulations have existed for decades, until recently, few of those regulations were developed with unmanned aircraft in mind.  The FAA plans to finalize regulations by 2015, however in 2012 they missed one of their regulatory guidelines, and experts believe the FAA may be unable to meet the 2015 deadline imposed on the agency by Congress.

   By 2015, Amazon claims that their Prime Air drones will be ready to deliver products within 30 minutes so long as the FAA allows it.
