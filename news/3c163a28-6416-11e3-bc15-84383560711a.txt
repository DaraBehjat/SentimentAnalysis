    Northern Illinois University’s loss in the 2013 MAC Finals against Bowling Green cost the MAC $17.5 million in bowl money. 
   
 
One football game cost a Division I collegiate athletic conference $17.5 million.  
And they call it amateur sports, eh?  
Prior to their 47-27 loss to Bowling Green in the MAC championship game on December 6th, Northern Illinois was positioned to make its second consecutive trip to a BCS bowl game.  These games yield $18 million payoffs, separately, to the conferences of the two participating schools.  
By succumbing to Bowling Green, however, NIU finds themselves relegated to the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl on December 26th versus 8-5 Utah State.  
And the payout to the MAC for placing a team in the Poinsettia Bowl?   Try $500,000 .  Just a mere $17.5 million less than what the MAC would have received had NIU defeated BG.  
Speaking of credit unions, we should credit Bowling Green for playing the MAC finals on the up-and-up.  The cynical among us might have suggested that they should have tanked that game away so as to ensure more money for the conference, and thus, themselves.  For their victory over NIU only afforded them a short trip to Detroit and a conference distribution of $750,000 in the Little Caesar’s Bowl versus a 6-6 Pittsburgh squad.  
This phenomenon is near and dear to my heart because of what happened the day after Thanksgiving in Reno in 2010 between Colin Kaepernick’s Nevada Wolfpack and then-small school darlings Boise State.  Undefeated going into that game, all Boise had to do was maintain the 24-7 advantage they created in the first half to ensure their BCS ticket.  I felt a distant connection to this game because in the summer of 2010 I taught a 6-week Economics of Sports class at Nevada, and one of my students was on the Wolfpack team.  That, and I spent many a day during that summer running the stairs at their stadium scenically surrounded by beautiful hills and mountains.  Perhaps the Boise players got caught gazing at the local scenery as well, for they lost the lead and eventually the game in overtime.  And with it, the conference lost a shot at BCS bowl money.  
Some losses hurt less than others, of course.  Though Missouri missed out on a shot of playing for the national championship with its loss to Auburn in the 2013 SEC championship game, their loss really didn’t impact the conference’s postseason financial take.  They still have one team in the national finals (payout of $22 million), another team in a BCS game ($18 million), and Mizzou themselves landed a highly visible bowl game against a strong opponent in arguably one of America’s finest sporting facilities (Mizzou faces Oklahoma State in the AT T Cotton Bowl on Friday, January 3rd at Cowboys Stadium in Dallas).  
NIU does not have much to apologize for.  They created a financial windfall for the MAC in 2012 with their BCS berth in the 2013 Orange Bowl versus Florida State (a 31-10 loss).  
But the results of the 2013 MAC finals just reaffirms that bowling for dollars at the end of the college football season is anything but an amateur endeavor.
