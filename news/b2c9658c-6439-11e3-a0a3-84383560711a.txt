Earlier this week  General Motors   General Motors  named  Mary Barra  as its first female chief executive.  
Barra, 51, is the fifth person to run GM in the past four years, and her appointment is the first time since 2009 that someone who came up in the ranks will be running the company.  
GM was relatively quiet on this first-ever nod. It didn’t trot Barra around to the morning news shows, it didn’t hype the change weeks before by whispering to journalists about “some big changes coming up top” or by releasing an embargoed press release days beforehand, and it didn’t give Barra a big press conference or group call with reporters to debrief. Barra took days to change her title on her Twitter feed, which still had fewer than 1,500 followers the evening of her move. (By comparison, Chrysler VP Ralph Gilles has nearly 17,000 followers, and he’s not even CEO.)  
Part of that could be the circumstances—insiders say Barra had the inside track for the top job anyway, and when former CEO Dan Akerson announced to the GM board this week that he was stepping down because his wife is extremely ill with cancer they simply decided to accelerate plans. Time constraints likely held back much of what could have been a deeper push to publicize Barra as the new head.  
At any rate, reaction around the auto industry has been generally positive, if lukewarm.  Stanford University -educated Barra was well-respected in her role as product chief who oversaw the critical success of several new GM vehicles include the Cadillac  CTS   CTS  and Chevrolet Impala, and the strongest official response I could elicit from an automaker was from Volkswagen: “Volkswagen congratulates General Motors on its appointment of Mary Barra as CEO. It’s encouraging to see the automotive industry cultivate top talent and to promote more women to leadership positions.”  
Pundits have been rather more divisive.  
Michelle Krebs, the senior analyst at Edmunds.com, called Barra’s ascension a “gigantic milestone.”  
Indeed, no woman has ever headed a major car company, and while half of car-buyers are women (women influence more than 80% of car-buying decisions, according to J.D. Power   Associates), the auto industry has continues to be male dominated at the C-level. In 1999, as Detroit bureau chief for  USA Today , Micheline Maynard interviewed all of the women officers at the Detroit car companies. At that time, there were 14. (This year, it must be said, there are also 14 women listed as senior officers on the car companies’ websites.)  
“That’s why it is a big deal,” Krebs said.  
Jack Nerad, executive editorial director and analyst at Kelley Blue Book, also praised the move.  
“America’s automakers have been the home to an increasing number of women who have entered and thrived in fields like engineering and production,” he said. “Mary Barra’s move…is the culmination of this decades-old progression.”  
Maynard, however,  took  a different view.  
“As much as GM will try to portray her as someone cut from industry cloth, Barra’s appointment should not seen as reflecting any great gains by women in the automobile industry,” she wrote. “It has long been and remains a tree house, where only the most focused and strongest willed women earn enough influence to sit at the conference table in key meetings, not taking notes in the chairs against the wall.”  
Indeed, for the time being, it seems wise that GM has balanced between gently promoting Barra publically without flaunting her as someone who came to the role just because of her gender.  
“They can’t be patronizing,” Krebs says. “GM must be artful in the way it handles this.”  
   Anyone who remembers the Government Motors years – or the Cadillac Cimarron – will know that being “ artful ” hasn’t quite been the forte of the company that long stood as the world’s largest automaker. Let’s see how it does this time around.
