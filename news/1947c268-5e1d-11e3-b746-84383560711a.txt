The average rate on a 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage, typically used for refinancing higher interest mortgages, also jumped 0.17 percentage point to 3.47%.

"In addition, revisions added 54,000 jobs in the prior month."     vidConfig.push({ videoArray : [ {id : "/video/news/2013/11/12/n-housing-bubble-california-home-prices-mortgage-rates-zillow.cnnmoney", hed: "Is there a housing bubble in California?"} ], playerprofile : 'story', playerid : 'cvp_0', divid : 'vid0', hedtarget : '#cnnplayer0 .cnnHeadline' });                    Is there a housing bubble in California?
