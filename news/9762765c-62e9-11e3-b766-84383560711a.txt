NEW YORK (CNNMoney)    Facebook has a new friend: the S P 500.    Standard   Poor's announced Wednesday that the social networking giant will be added to the benchmark index after the market closes on December 20, and will also be added to the S P 100.  Facebook   ( FB ,  Fortune 500 )  shares rose 4% on the news in after-hours trading Wednesday.

     Facebook will replace testing equipment company  Teradyne Inc.    ( TER ) in the S P 500 and energy infrastructure firm  The Williams Companies   ( WMB ,  Fortune 500 )  in the S P 100.     For Facebook, the benefits of joining the S P 500 club are clear: an expanded investor base and validation that the company is one of the most important in the country.     For the average investor, the move will make it easier to own a small piece of Facebook. According to Morningstar, there are 1,300 mutual funds and 13 exchange-traded funds that use the S P 500 as their primary benchmark. They will all add Facebook shares to their holdings once it is included in the index.

Its current market capitalization of around $123 billion will place it among the 50 largest companies in the index.      MetLife   ( MET ,  Fortune 500 )  was the fastest company to join the S P 500, just eight months after its initial public offering.     It's been 19 months since Facebook's  rocky debut  on the public market. Shares initially fell following an IPO marred by  technical errors , but have since bounced back, rallying more than 80% so far this year.      Google   ( GOOG ,  Fortune 500 )  was added to the S P 500 after about 19 months as a public company as well -- it went public in August 2004 and didn't join the index until March 2006.     S P also announced Wednesday that clothing retailer   Abercrombie   Fitch   ( ANF )  and communication technology firm  JDS Uniphase Corp.   ( JDSU )  will be leaving the index, to be replaced by   Alliance Data Systems   ( ADS )  and floor-covering producer  Mohawk Industries   ( MHK ,  Fortune 500 ) .
