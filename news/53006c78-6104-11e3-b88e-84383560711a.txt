                      comments       FHA to pull back on big mortgages   By Gregory Wallace   @gregorywallace     December 8, 2013: 12:35 PM ET                     NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   The Federal Housing Administration has announced plans to reduce its stake in the market, an indication it sees some signs of strength in real estate.    The agency, which insures low down-payment  mortgages , is reducing the upper limits of what it will backstop in areas where home prices are high.

       Starting in the new year, the biggest cap in these areas will drop to $625,500 from $729,750. Limits will be set lower in about 650 counties as a result, the agency said.     The FHA will maintain current limits in areas where home prices are lower and said the move will allow it to refocus on less wealthy homebuyers.

The FHA said the program quadrupled its activity "as the private market retreated."     But by doing so, it took also significant hits from defaults, and the  agency has been trying to right its own balance sheet .     The agency was forced to ask Congress for $1.7 billion in late September, and has  hiked premiums . Several years earlier, the government took over housing giants  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .

The FHA says it currently has nearly 5 million mortgages in its portfolio.              Find homes for sale
