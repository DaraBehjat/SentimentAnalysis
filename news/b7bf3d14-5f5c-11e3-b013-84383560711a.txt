An  adult escort service  received $173,000 from the massive settlement fund set up to compensate those harmed by  BP's   BP's  Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.  
BP, the London-based oil and natural gas major, paid for full-page advertisements in several U.S. newspapers on Thursday challenging the Gulf Settlement Program’s decision to pay an adult escort service $173,000 for lost income as a result of the oil spill.  
“The IRS wouldn’t accept this claim. But the Gulf Settlement Program did,” the advertisement stated.  
The company accused the Gulf Settlement Program of ignoring ‘red flags’ and pushing this claim for payment without investigating its legitimacy or asking for additional documentation.  
Given the significant cost of full page newspaper advertisements, BP probably spent significantly more than $173,000 on this small part of a sweeping campaign to undercut the Gulf Settlement Program.
