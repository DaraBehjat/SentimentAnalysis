                      comments       Iran oil exports rise as sanctions eased    By Virginia Harrison   @vharrisoncnn     December 11, 2013: 11:21 AM ET               Iran has been shipping more oil to China and Taiwan in the last few weeks.          LONDON (CNNMoney)   An easing of sanctions has helped support a rise in oil exports from Iran, though a tough stance from major energy consumers will limit further take-up of supplies.    Iranian exports rose by about 10% in November, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly market report published Wednesday.

     The Paris-based agency also said it expected global oil demand to rise by 1.2 million barrels per day to 92.4 million next year.     Iran's export lift follows an  accord  struck last month which relaxed some economic sanctions in exchange for assurances over the country's nuclear program.

The IEA estimates Iran's oil exports rose by 89,000 barrels per day to 850,000 barrels per day last month as sales to China and Taiwan climbed. Restrictions on Iranian oil remain in force in the U.S. and Europe.     A relaxation of rules concerning insurance for oil tankers under the agreement make it easier for Iran to ship crude, as well as extract oil from storage facilities - which prompted the rise in exports.

For the first time in decades, supplies from non-OPEC producers topped 43 million barrels per day last month -- thanks in part to the U.S.  shale boom .     New technologies such as  hydraulic fracking , which has made the extraction of oil and gas from shale rock commercially viable, has spurred the U.S. to a leading position among global oil producers.     vidConfig.push({ videoArray : [ {id : "/video/news/2013/09/18/n-texas-fracking-richard-quest.cnnmoney", hed: "'Moving in droves' to Midland, Texas"} ], playerprofile : 'story', playerid : 'cvp_0', divid : 'vid0', hedtarget : '#cnnplayer0 .cnnHeadline' });                    'Moving in droves' to Midland, Texas          At the same time, output from oil cartel OPEC dropped as countries including Libya and Nigeria continued to experience disruption to supplies.     The IEA forecast last month that the U.S. would replace OPEC giant  Saudi Arabia  as the world's top energy producer by 2015.
